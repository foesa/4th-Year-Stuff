\section{SMART Goals}
For the course of my Internship, I decided to set myself a mixture of both technical goals and soft goals. I decided this as I thought my growth as an engineer is not only bound by the depth of my technical skills but also by my soft skills as I need to develop my interpersonal skills also.

\subsection{Technological Goals}
\subsubsection{Goal 1: Learn 1 new technology in asynchronous programming and successfully implement it in a task.}
\textbf{Specific}: This goal is specific to my development as an engineer as I feel this is an area I'm unfamiliar with as I haven't used it at all in my college work.  This is something that I wish to work on during the course of my internship so I can improve my level of skill in this area and thus strengthen my engineering skill as a result. 
\\ \textbf{Measurable}: This goal can be measured by the completion of a pull request to the main code base in which I have utilised a technology in asynchronous programming in the code I have written. 
\\ \textbf{Achievable}:This goal is achievable as from talking with my team lead,  our team uses asynchronous process in the code base we're responsible for,  so completing this goal should be within the scope of my internship.  There are numerous asynchronous technologies that are deployed in Hubspot so for me to complete this goal, I should be able to achieve this with the help of my team.
\\ \textbf{Relevant}: The relevance of this skill is that companies often have to deal with tasks asynchronously due to the fact they may take quite some time to complete,  so we can't let our code just hang while it completes.  Improving my skill in this field is definitely of benefit to me as an engineer as it makes me more well rounded. 
\\ \textbf{Time Bound}: This goal can be completed as soon as I'm given a task that requires me to use asynchronous processes.  I have set myself a deadline of the end of April to complete this goal. 
\subsubsection{Goal 2: Develop my coding style to be compatible with the world of work to reduce time how long my pull requests are in review by understanding the coding practices at Hubspot}
\textbf{Specific}: This goal is for me to improve my coding style and the way I code to be more professional in nature and thus more compatible with the world of work. This goal is specific as I've specified why I wish to achieve this and how this can be achieved. 
\\ \textbf{Measurable}: This goal is measurable by comparing the length of time it takes for my pull requests to be merged to the main code base.  This goal can also be measured by the number of comments pertaining to coding style in pull requests changing.
\\ \textbf{Achievable}:This goal can be achieved as there's a document at Hubspot of coding practices and architectural patterns to be deployed when coding.  By my reading,  understanding and most importantly,  implementation of this document I can achieve this goal.  My team members reinforcement on maintaining these standards in day to day work and pull requests can help me achieve this also.
\\ \textbf{Relevant}: This is a relevant goal to have as the readability and maintainability of a code base is very important especially when a codebase grows in size and becomes more and more difficult to pay off the technological debt.  We can help avoid this somewhat by maintaining standards and practices in how we should code,  to reduce the amount of time necessary to maintaining legacy code and increase the ease of understanding of people that may reuse your code later.
\\ \textbf{Time Bound}: This goal is something that I'll continuously be working on over the course of my internship.  I've set myself a deadline of the end of my internship to be able to fully incorporate the coding style.
\subsection{Soft Goals}
\subsubsection{Goal 1: Be able to receive feedback and also give back constructive feedback in order to increase my growth as an engineer by giving me instruction in areas I may be lagging behind, whilst being able to give my team lead direction in how best I learn and thus grow}
\textbf{Specific}: This goal is related to how I receive feedback as an engineer and how I take the feedback,  whilst also being able to support my growth as an engineer by giving me team lead instruction in how best I learn as an engineer so that can be accommodated to increase my growth in turn. 
\\ \textbf{Measurable}:This goal is measurable through the feedback I receive from my team lead.  Measuring soft skills is often more difficult as they aren't as easily quantified,  but for this specific goal it can be measured via the feedback I receive from my team lead in terms of how I've acted given previous feedback and how I've implemented previous feedback.
\\ \textbf{Achievable}: This is an achievable goal as I have weekly 1:1's with my team lead to discuss things and see how I'm getting along.  Through these 1:1's I can get and give feedback frequently enough that I can achieve this goal. 
\\ \textbf{Relevant}: This skill has plenty relevance as an important aspect of growth is via taking feedback and implementing this feedback to plug the holes so to speak.  Equally,  being able to give quality feedback can be very important as you can help nurture those around you and show those around you the best way to interact with you to fast track your growth as we all learn differently and thus need different styles of interaction.
\\ \textbf{Time Bound}: This goal is something I will continuously be working on thorough the course of my internship as learning to take feedback and giving good constructive feedback requires a long time to learn how to do well. 
\subsubsection{Goal 2: Increase my networking skills by having at least 10 1:1's with people on and outside my team to widen my network and learn more about other people's progression in Hubspot}
\textbf{Specific}:The goal here is to increase the amount of people I know in the industry by talking and interacting with numerous people in Hubspot and learning about the path they took to reach the different roles and such they've gained. This goal is specific to me ability to network and narrowed down to an essential part of networking,  talking to new people. 
\\ \textbf{Measurable}: This goal is measurable in the amount of 1:1's and new connections I succeed in making over my time in Hubspot.  If I can successfully have at least 10 1:1's with different people in Hubspot,  I think I'll have achieved my goal of increasing my networking skills and also widening my network.
\\ \textbf{Achievable}: This goal is achievable as in Hubspot there are multiple slack channels dedicated to arranging 1:1's coffee chats with anyone that's interested in partaking.  Also,  my team lead can assist me in arranging meetings with engineers and team leads on other teams also.
\\ \textbf{Relevant}: This goal has relevance as whilst your technical skill as an engineer is important,  it's difficult to show how good an engineer you are when you meet someone for the first time.  Instead the most important skill here is how you network and how well you are able to sell yourself.  Also, by talking to people that have been in the industry for a while,  you can learn from them and their mistakes to streamline your progression in your career. 
\\ \textbf{Time Bound}: I intend to complete at least one 1:1  a week between now and the end of my internship which should total to more than 10.  I've set myself a hard deadline of the 2nd week of May.
