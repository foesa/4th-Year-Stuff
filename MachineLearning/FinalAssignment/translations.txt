{"text" : "Resident Evil HD Remaster is definitely one of the best Resident Evil games out there, my personal favourite! The tank controls or even the alternate controls can take some time to get used to for the casual gamer. But once you get used to the controls, the game becomes more fun. The game takes place in the Mansion. The Mansion is very spacious in the places you can access so backtracking and getting lost will happen on your first playthrough quite often. This can scare away new players from finishing this game but I strongly recommend for those who experience this at an extreme level to fight through it. Once you finish one playthrough, the next playthrough you play will be shorter due to you knowing what objectives to do (It took me 11 hours on easy to pass the game my first playthrough and then it took me just under 3 hours on my next on normal).  Item management is very crucial in this game due to you having to prioritize what you need carry on you (chris can only hold 6 items, Jill - 8 at a time), also prioritizing what zombies to kill is crucial (ammunition can be scarce, try avoiding zombies if you can), this is what makes it a true classic survival horror experience. For a newbie, i would recommend you to play on easy first and then gradually go from there as getting used to the gameplay mechanics/controls can be tricky the first time you play. Anybody that is a fan of the resident evil series or someone trying to get into the series...i would strongly recommend to buy this game! "}

{"text" : "This game is very nice.  It's a 2D side-view management/survival game where the player will order dwarves to do tasks (digging, building, fighting...).  There is a campaign mode where each map has a goal that will, once finished, enable the next map. There is also a sandbox mode with various options to set for greater enjoyment. And there is also a multiplayer mode (from a DLC) that adds even more variety to the game.  I enjoyed playing it very much. Although i don't have as many hours on this game as i wish because "life" keeps me from it, i did buy and play all the DLCs and i think they are worth the price. The best part of this game is being able to dig out almost all of the map to build whatever we want instead. The worst part is the very slow release rate of new content. Because this game has so much potential left, i'm waiting eagerly for each and every new update. Like all games, this one has room from improvement, but the devs add fixes and features in between DLC releases so it never feels like the game is or becoming stagnant. "}
{"text" : "A little too much gunfire for a Star Trek game but since the federation is back at war with the Klingons ... seems legit.

{"text" : "Definitely not the best numbered part of the Resident Evil franchise, and far from the worst. By the way, the latter were not few in the series: one, two. Is that bad already? But I’m just getting started. The seventh movement breathed new life into the series that had stagnated in one place, just not to say that it brought something radically different from the earlier works. In addition to the first-person view and a completely new main character, in no way connected with the characters of the past parts, there is nothing in this part that we have not seen. But this time the developers did not get the usual enemies, compared to the previous games in the series, the local monster park is a huge step back in terms of creativity and interesting mechanics, their presence can only be justified by the plot - poor people who accidentally fell into the clutches of a family and perished in nothingness from the virus. It seems that even the ridiculous slugs from were more interesting than the local cuttlefish and blockheads with teeth. Is it really the case, every opponent there was a pain in the ass, isn't it a success? Admiration for the elaboration of the appearance of enemies and flashbacks transform the pictures of bygone times: how, with a beat of my heart, almost with trembling hands, I ran away from a ganado with a chainsaw. And what alone was it worth. The question is, where did the crazy Japanese fantasy go, did it go with? The level designers have frankly done poorly. I understand it seems that according to the plot we are in a fucking swamp, it is natural that apart from the species of the crocodile govn and village buildings nothing else shines for us. The house and surroundings of the Baker family's possessions are, of course, interesting in themselves, representing one large connected maze. From the side it blows with rustic comfort, you will imbue it and instantly cover it with bile, and the gloomy walls of the house will begin to press from all sides, giving an idea of ​​being in a real trap, that is, a cage from which it is so difficult to get out. The rest of the locations is completely gray and faded in one format. Other parts of the series also lacked stars from the sky, however, they had their own creative design solutions, some solid pieces from all locations were etched into the memory. Take the laboratory where the experiments were carried out, for example. This time, the developers managed to make things worse. Where are those glittering floors, a bunch of equipment worth hundreds of millions, solid dimensions and terrible indestructible creatures from test tubes? I liked the plot, it is written at a sufficient level. At least the game did not lull me to sleep, drawing deeper into sleep, there was interest and a certain motivation to return to the passage. During the passage, it felt as if you were watching a mini-series about the village maddens, to which the poor boy from the city got, they torment him, and he is trying with all his might to get out. And I sit and wonder, saying aloud: Moments of the game, when you could be sawed off in a moment - a gold mine. It is a pity that in the end this doom and simplicity disappears for good, then the game grabs the spirit of the last shooter parts, you just grab a shotgun and go to knead everyone who gets in the way. The script component is really not bad, but not without sin, many similarities and comparisons arose throughout the entire journey, if you think about it, there are a dime a dozen of similar films about village showdowns. Despite many familiar elements inherent in the games of the series, it does not fully feel like a part of the abode of evil. after the disapproval, it seemed to have crossed the line, went beyond the proven framework for years, allowing herself to cross out everything created earlier, starting from scratch. With this, they probably wanted to assure the fans that their company can still surprise and bring something new to a long stagnant mansion, which began with an atmospheric horror and ended with a bright popcorn attraction in the manner of popular Hollywood films of our time. To some extent, they managed to breathe a bit of life into the series, going through the many cries of fans about forgotten (and also beaten) roots and comparison with the game. The seventh part has a bit of everything from all the iconic numbered residents, and that's great. One epithet for me is good old stuff in a beautiful new wrapper. Separately about the addition. The new image turned out to be excellent, restyling clearly benefited him. Now he is young and much prettier, in character he remains the same man of honor, as before, ready to do anything to save his comrades. But a certain charm was lost that ex-Chris had - in his eyes he saw all that horror experienced over the years, it was extremely important, because this way we empathize more with the character, at the sight of his incommensurably big problems.

{"text" : "Vikings -  Wolves of Midgard This game is a traditional Hack'n Slay and is clearly following in the tradition of the Diablo games. ------------------- The gameplay is not very varied. It's basically just your character slashing away on your way through a not so open terrain. Given there are deserts, gloomy windy beaches, coves, and so on. The fact that sometimes you also have to fight against the cold or toxic gas in these levels, adds a nice twist. One great innovation is that you can build up "your" village step by step with various materials that can be looted throughout the levels ( wood, iron, ..). Later on you will also find e.g. runesmiths in your village that will help you on your journey by enchanting your weapons. Big Bonus points for being able to play through the game in co-op. GREAT !! I enjoyed the musical score here, it's well played and adds a lot to the immersion and atmosphere of the game. The sounds of the attacking trolls, their animals or enemy soldiers  are quite realistic as well. Sweet :) The difficulty is set rather low, so I would suggest if you are an avid gamer, that you choose hard for your first playthrough. Normal to me feels like easy. And there is also the Walhalla mode, which is the permdeath mode. Graphic wise it was pretty good for a game of this type. In the very first level, which is set in a snowy mountainy area, you can even make out your footprints in the snow. Which is kinda cool. "}

It is also worth noting a large selection of weapons and equipment, here you can play as a nimble peasant in rags with a frying pan and a knife, and as a heavy knight in elite armor with a two-handed sword. The maps are very pleasing, but you can see from them that they are not finished and will expand. The main disadvantage of the game is balance!

{"text" : "Rooster cake recipe I do not know what can be said about this game and therefore I will write a recipe for Rooster cake. We will take the simplest butter cream and ordinary biscuit as a basis, for decoration - coconut flakes and marmalade slices. A few simple culinary actions - and before us is a bright and cute "Rooster" cake. Ingredients: For biscuit: eggs - 5 pcs .; starch - 30 g; flour - 100 g; butter - 30 g; sugar - 150 g; baking powder - 1 tsp; vanilla sugar - 1 tsp. For impregnation: sugar - 40 g; water (boiling water) - 60 ml; cognac - 1-2 tsp. For the filling: peanuts - 100 g; condensed milk - about ½ can. For cream: butter - 200 g; condensed milk - 7-8 tbsp. spoons. For decoration: marmalade slices of different colors - 15-20 pcs.; coconut flakes - about 50 g. After carefully separating the whites from the yolks, place them in a deep container and beat with a mixer. We make sure that no yolk particles or any specks get into the protein mass (the working bowl must be perfectly dry and clean). Gradually add half of the sugar, beat the whites until firm. The correct consistency should remain in place when the bowl is turned over. Beat the egg yolks separately with the second half of granulated sugar and vanilla sugar. We work with a mixer for about 5 minutes (until the composition is thickened and increased in volume). Introduce yolk in small portions to the protein mass, each time gently stirring the mixture from bottom to top. Combine flour with starch and baking powder. Sift in small portions onto the egg mass, mix from bottom to top. We work carefully - it is important not to sediment the fluffy dough! When all the dry mixture is mixed in, pour the melted and cooled butter along the edge of the bowl. Stir the dough again from bottom to top, but not too long. Cover the bottom of a split form with a diameter of 22 cm with a circle of parchment. We fill the container with the prepared dough and send it to the oven heated to 180 degrees. We bake the biscuit for about 20-30 minutes. We check readiness with a match / toothpick. If possible, before forming the cake, it is advisable to allow the biscuit to rest overnight at room temperature, tightening it with a film. In this case, the baked goods will keep their shape better and will crumble less when cut. We proceed to the most interesting thing - the formation of the silhouette of a rooster. Cut off the top of the biscuit, leaving only the base 1 cm thick. Take a regular cup or round bowl, place it on top to the edge of the cake. Cut out a piece of biscuit along the contour of the cup, this part will be used as a "rooster's head". From the base of the cake, now looking like a crescent, cut a small corner on the left side, remove it. We transfer the biscuit blank to a large plate. In place of the cut-off corner, we apply the circle previously cut from the cake using a cup. Thus, we get a figure that looks like the body of a rooster. For impregnation, we completely dissolve the sugar in boiling water. Cool the liquid, add brandy. Soak the base of the cake thoroughly. Fry peanuts in a dry frying pan for 7-10 minutes, stir occasionally. Remove from heat and cool. After removing the husks, crush the peanuts in a blender bowl until small pieces are obtained (but not crumbs). Grind the top of the biscuit and the previously cut corner of the cake with a blender. Combine peanuts and biscuit crumbs. Knead with your hands, gradually adding condensed milk, until a sticky mass is obtained. For the cream, beat in a very soft butter. Add the condensed milk one spoon at a time, continuing to work with the mixer. As a result, we get a homogeneous butter cream. Apply a thin layer of cream to the soaked base of the cake. Spread the sticky mass of peanuts and biscuit crumbs evenly on top. Cover the cake with the rest of the butter cream. Sprinkle the surface and sides of the dessert with coconut. We spread the colored gummy slices to simulate the tail and wings of a rooster. Cut the "scallop" and "beak" from red marmalade. Draw the "eye" with melted chocolate or, again, cut it out of marmalade. The Rooster cake is ready! Before drinking tea, be sure to insist the dessert for at least 3-4 hours in the refrigerator. Bon Appetit! "}

{"text" : "I wasn't so sure about this game when it first came out but i decided to give it a try and i can tell you that this game is totally worth it. I like the idea that even a noob like me can learn how to change a graphic card,rams,cpu and preaty much it gives you an inside of how computers are built in general. Too bad this game isn't finished,the content that you are geting right now for 20 bucks isn't worth it.. the carrer isn't that big as you might expect. The things that you can do are limited tho,after 3-4 hours everything gets repetitive,nothing new happens. Throughout the campain you can purchase 2 more working stations witch are a good improvment if you wan't to earn money faster. Since we talking about money,they need to re-think the money you get for a job tho,sometimes you pay more just to buy what the person needs than what he's giving you for fixing the computer and this isn't how it works,and since it is a simulator they should get it right.  Now i will list some things that i wish to see in the game. 1-Water coling (i don't know if it is already in the game but so far i haven't seen anything) 2-Changing locations,throughout the game to be able to move your working station somewhere else,or buy a house or anything new 3-To be able to hire people to work for you,i think this would be something that at least i want to see,ofc you will need to pay your employees. 4- People bringing what they wan't to change in their computer: maybe not all of them,but wouldn't it be nice to see someone that want a new graphic card to deliver it to you and tell you just put it in, 5-Another "job" that i think you should add is this: What if someone just bought a new case and they don't know how to put their components inside it? i think it would be cool to be able to remove all the components and to put them in another case. 6. Be able to talk to customers: Let's just say you discovered that you pay more to replace his cpu than the ammount of money you get for it. An sistem where you cand send him an email telling him that he/she has to pay more if he/she whant's you to repair the computer. 7 I want to see a stock sistem for all the components,this might make the game a bit harder if you are unnable to buy something straight away. 8 Cable managmet. These are all the things that i wish to see in the game in the near future. Overeall the game is fun,also a preaty good learning session but don't expect to be able to do much "}

{"text" : "Review on the premise of early access In the zonsaba fashion, the setting is based on the theme of uninhabited island life. The atmosphere of the whole game starts from one of the isolated islands in the sea with a very strong craft + survival element, but each island is very small. A rubber boat rowing is a means to cross the islands. Of course, you can swim, but there are sharks here and there. ■ Good points ■ Since it is difficult to secure resources, it is easy to collect resources. For those who want to play, each island is small so that you can concentrate on how to secure resources and craft, if you want to collect resources, you have to walk around the neighboring islands etc. The setting is attractive. Survival on an uninhabited island, which is unlikely to be a genre that sets it apart from other works. For solo game lovers, it may be new to collect resources and not be disturbed by anyone. ■ It's a solo game, but I get bored quickly because I don't have much to do anyway. The purpose of spending time collecting resources is natural because I got the impression that I could not express it well, but there are many bugs and it is difficult to proceed. Also, the operability is also very bad, even though it is called early access, there is a strong impression that the development progress is really low Even if the above part is corrected at the development stage, the appeal of the uninhabited island life setting is to play in the game It may be a setting that gets tired unexpectedly when you look at it, but it is in a fairly early state, but when it becomes official, it will not be disturbed by anyone There is no doubt that it will be a title that can be recommended for those who are attracted to uninhabited island life. I'm too accustomed to being a sonsaba, I wasn't attracted to the game for the purpose of surviving food security. Personally, I wouldn't play even if it became official. Uninhabited island life It may be interesting and not interesting. No lol "}

{"text" : "! Disclaimer ! I'm not a huge fan or veteran of a "Hidden Object Game" so my review on it might bias since i didn't play much games of the said genre, the only things i remeber is playing some Artifex Mundi games when i was a teenager, so i pretty much know what to expect & do in these kind of games. "Darkarta: A Broken Heart's Quest" is an award-winning adventure game made by Tuttifrutti Interactive.  I can say for sure that if you like adventures, finding hidden objects, solving puzzles & riddles, things that making your brain work, and you wanna to enjoy a nice story with a happy ending - then you definitely don't want to miss this game.  The Plot of the game is simple on the surface, but complex in the end. An adventure of the loving mother who goes on a quest to save her daughter, filled with mystery, drama, puzzles and a whole cast of unique and memorable characters This game impressed me for real and got me into it's story. It's ADDICTIVE since each puzzle is original, challenging, and none of them frustrating, cause after minute or two you'll be solving em like pancakes! (And it adds a nice flavour when you're feeling yourself smart) Oh and if you're having any trouble with them there are hints available OR alternative puzzle to complete in order to progress (It's always nice to have options). I liked playing this title to my heart's content. And definetely looking forward to a sequel or any other game from these developers. "}

{"text" : "Only complaint I have about this game, since there's been major improvements since I started playing almost 2 years ago. The Community itself is quite toxic, especially some of the most known streamers. BHVR have outright banned people based on nothing but a Streamer's suspicion that there was foul play. If you lag in game against a streamer, and they report it, you're gone, no proof or investigation. The development team favour streamers over everyone else and it is wrong. Ignoring that the game is fun, not hard to get into. Ignore the occasional toxic player and you'll be fine. Never be upset you don't escape or don't kill everyone, at the end of the day all you get out of it is bloodpoints. "}

With tight inputs, smooth controls and an animation style that will have you saying, "Well golly jee, that's a rootin' tootin' good time." this game is a classic in the making. I haven't played a game in some time where I died constantly and it made the exerience all the better.

But some of the quests turned out to be boring, but the developers assure that the missed quest will not affect the plot, and it is. There were pleasant unexpected twists in the plot. The mechanics of the battle were a little strange, because fighting with a sword and a shield, the battle was not easy and I lost a lot of health, but sometimes I just took a bow and I could kill the whole army with a slight loss of health, even the allies in battles did not behave clearly ...

I do have a second character I did start with a friend, which took a bunch of those hours as well.  The game allows for different builds of characters, which can allow for replay-ability with different formats - with melee based, assassin-esque based, mage based characters. Cool feature is the ability to play as a dual class. Which allows for different combos and sets. There is an ability to respec as well via an NPC if you decide to reformat, so you can choose a different format if you find you are having issues. There are wide range of merchants that usually have the best stuff if you are able to friend a town, faction to the max. You can also hit certain areas again for possible drops, to help improve your weapons and armors. In addition, there are different gems to upgrade abilities of weapons - from shooting fireballs or causing poison damage.  I personally, have nothing to complain about the game. I personally wish I had more time to play. I would give the game a 10/10, as it is one of my favorite games from this year. I do hope they create a sequel or even extend the universe more. "}

Although I still think the final fight has major balance issues. I realised I had missed a key side quest that could have helped upgrade my characters. Also they admit there are issues and they are to be looking into both issues 1 and 2 highlighted below. As for the equipment, I suppose we'll have to see if they add more exciting features than just base stat changes. e.g. specific effects and abilities would be nice. Although I have noticed a few resistance boosts too. As this is a free I would recommend you try it and feedback to game developers.  Overall there was a lot positive to this game. However, it gets a negative review from me for the following: 1. No formation for party and enemies always attack archers and spell casters first Although I wouldn't mind this, most enemies seem to have some sort of ranged attack and can kill them in one to three hits, getting two attacks per go (including ranged AoE attacks in some cases). 2. Some of the enemies are completely overpowered to the point that the game is just unfair (The Guardian at the end kills my archer before I get chance to react and the wizard is put into critical health). 3. The items you find seem bland and just seem to change your base stats. If the first two were rectified I could put up with 3 based on what is good about the game. "}
{"text" : "In a word: cool. Before moving on to the gameplay, at the beginning I want to praise the plot. He's really interesting here, really science fiction with the romance of space. After passing through, I felt like I had read a good book or watched an excellent multi-part film. Especially pleased with the ending after the credits, I have never seen such an approach to nonlinearity, bravo, Arkine Studios! Actually, since the game was created by the same people who released Disonord, you can find many parallels, but there are many differences. The stylistics of people's faces remained the same as in the disa, but the iron environment of the station is more realistic and adult, in comparison with the drawing of previous games. The gameplay has become slower, without teleportations, but in my opinion more varied. Since the player is in conditions of limited supplies, he wants to constantly save. You see the enemy in front of you and instead of firing and wasting cartridges, you begin to examine the environment and think how to solve the issue more tactfully. With the advent of new abilities and the accumulation of supplies, the gameplay changes, accelerates, at some point you start to run at lightning speed and jump high, like some predator, distributing left and right shot, a grenade or a laser. The levels themselves are quite large, multi-level, with many hiding places, locked doors, small logic puzzles. Moreover, you can almost always enter the territory in different ways, which is very pleasing. Before you had time to pump the necessary skill for breaking the door, it doesn't matter, over there you can go further through the pipes from the next room. At the same time, pipes and secret passages are not as "obvious" as in the Dysonord, it is not always possible to find them here before entering the closed zone. Before buying, I watched a bunch of videos and was afraid that the enemies would be monotonous. Well, like "some black facial expressions" of different sizes. But as it turned out, the battles were very juicy, but not the biggest part of the game. Exploring zones, revealing secrets and mysteries, performing small optional tasks, various moral dilemmas, more inherent in the old Biovar games - this is the very relish of the gameplay. But mimics also play the role of a background, where you encounter them in different conditions and from that the battles always take place in different ways. In one place, turrets can help you, in another it will be complicated by the lack of gravity, in the third it will be possible to use explosive cylinders, in the fourth in stealth you can drive in a shot, and in the fifth, for example, there he may have a cover, in the sixth you will break the shield in order to burn out everyone with electricity ... This multilevel, nonlinearity, the forced use of the environment in battles (I played at a high level of difficulty), pumping, the ability to go into outer space, an addictive plot and tactical battles in the Disonord style - all this makes the game very, very good. Why, before the purchase, it seemed to me that it would be much worse, simpler and shorter. And then 30 hours of selected and action, and stealth, and a plot. In general, I recommend Disonord to lovers and not only. "}

{"text" : "Day will come after night, spring will come after winter, but the truth will remain unchanged. This incredible story begins with the pleasant sounds of music reminiscent of a French accordion (or maybe this is it). Made in point-and-click mechanics, the quest resembles one of those strange dreams when you wake up and think: 1) what was it all about now? 2) I want more! The degree of absurdity is exactly such as to attract, but not repulse, and the world of the game does not pounce on you from the doorway, forcing you to understand everything at once - it is gradually revealed even in this short prologue. Whatever-for-the-country is a wonderful quest taking place in a kind of parallel world created by his "goddess" Beatrice, she also dooms prisoners to imprisonment in this world. Naturally, there is a way out or not - it remains an intrigue, and it will not be possible to solve it in 20 minutes of the game. In my opinion, this intrigue is not brought to a sufficient degree, however, the demo allows to fully appreciate the mechanics, music and environment. From the technical side, everything is fine, with the exception of one minus - for some reason, achievements for passing are not awarded. It is possible that such a fate befell only me: 'D There are no complaints about everything else, the world is holistic, the soundtrack matches the picture, and the voice acting .. it is just beautiful. Nothing is clear, but oh-very interesting, and I want to understand all this. Nice design, graphics and soundtrack are wonderful, for my own eyes the drawing and details of the world are very pleasant.

{"text" : "Wow, this thing is almost 13 years old now. I can't believe I never played it before. Even as a "retro game" it beats most of the games released nowadays. Graphics is old, but for a game released in 2004 its way better than expected. One thing I noticed straight away is how good facial animations are. I don't remember any other game had that at the time. As a first person shooter there is so many little things this game does great. Starting with a physics engine, I can easily say that never have I ever played something on this level. Gravity gun (weapon you get in-game) allows you to kill enemies in huge amount of ways with various objects. Other than that, you can interact with almost any object in-game and use it in some way. All of the levels are designed with great attention to detail. You can never get bored exploring all of the corners looking for supplies and ammo. It is not just "run and gun" as most FPS games are today. Some of the levels require you to use a boat, buggy, crane etc. There are also small physics puzzles you can stumble upon that require to be solved in order to proceed. All of this just shows how powerful this game engine is. It's a shame Valve doesn't make more games like this. "}

{"text" : "Excellent game, ubi has dont a fantastic job of fixing gameplay balances and ironing out the many tech issues that were present at launch. Being an avid CS player I really took to the game instantly, after not playing Siege for nearly 2 years (early-mid 2016) am glad I came back at to it since the game is at a much better state now. I remember very high ping severs and uplay constantly messing up the connection mid-game back then now almost all of that is gone, some minor tech issue are present but that depends from PC to PC. My only complaint is that the operators cost a lot of renown (in-game currency you get from playing) and if you get the starters edition even the basic operators takes 15-16 hours of play to unlock even one operator. The seaon pass opeartors are worse costing 25k nenown and taking almost 25-35 hours to unlock or cost 5 USD per operator which is a bit steep imo, other than that ranked matchmaking is still in beta and in a broken state even after so many years so they need that fixed as well. Also connections errors still exist but are less frequent than before. Just dont buy the starters edition its not worth it as unlocking the other base operators will take a crap ton of time instead buy the standard edition or the more advanced editions if you want extra R6 credits (currency used to unlock yearly operators) or just flat out get them with the season passes/gold or complete editions. Lastly if you dont have a very powerful GPU avoid downloading the ultra hd textures DLC as it is a whopping 34gb download which you wont use if you dont have that sort of GPU and with each new operator and map that size keeps increasing so yeah go to Properties -> DLC -> unselect the ultra hd textures pack manually to stop it from downloading or even after you have downloaded to not use/remove it.

{"text" : "Hello everyone . Once upon a time I read the book Metro 2033. After this event, after about a year or two, I saw on the EX.UA website that was still working. What my surprise was when I saw that this was a game, a GAME. I had no words. I revised it 10 times, after which I began to visit the site more and more often to see the record that the release took place. Later, I saw on the Internet a familiar cover to me, Metro 2033. I quickly downloaded the whole thing and started to go through. At that time I still remembered some parts of that "Treler". It dawned on me, the author of the video cut out a good half of the gameplay, and I got confused on almost every level (especially in Dead City 1). Because of this level, I was terribly burning). After some time, I was still able to pass, for some reason, the most difficult level in my life. Further passing was not a big deal, except for the level "D-6" and "Biomass", because at the first level I always died The miller, and the second one is just an unbearable tap. When my passage came to an end, for some reason they started there were tears, this music, these words, then they stuck into my soul so much that I wanted to just play and play, over and over again. The re-release in the form of "Redux" did not cause such feelings, but the very good graphics stretched the situation. In my opinion, that The 2010 metro is still better, although there are not very good graphics, there are bugs and other shortcomings, but still it is many times more atmospheric than Redux. And yet I passed this game a long time ago in the old version to a bad end where there are black kill, well, this time went to good. For me, the part that was earlier much more atmospheric and soulful than "Redux" everything was somehow darker, more hardcore, more interesting and felt "Horor" and "Hardcore". Well, the metro will always remain in my heart and memory, on the way of the Metro there is a ray of hope, which I did not pass, I will not waste time and will start to pass. Thank you for reading my little story. "}

{"text" : "I used to play pirated editions, and now I have to make up for tickets and review it. The whole process takes about 25 hours, which is quite a classic ARPG of the vampire genre. There are heavy wars and plagues, and there are dead lives and freedoms. In Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate, you can experience a vibrant London, and in the vampire, all you see is the suppressed and gloomy fog. The game’s main and branch plots, art, game graphics, and bgm are all excellent, but the game content is not mature enough, easy to get lost, rough combat feel (such as confused judgment) and mobile feel are one of the games that is difficult to cover. Big mistakes (to be honest, I went with the expectations of the main action open-world vampire RPG), although it has a very thoughtful skill tree system. In addition, this game.. There are no buttons for jumping or active defense, but there is a setting of stamina bar that can slowly recover over time. The stamina bar is consumed in different degrees to dodge running attacks. The enemy can also be reduced by stun attacks. The "posture bar" of "stance" is a bit soulful. Later, I discovered that this was the work of the same production team of "Forget Me Not" and "Life Is Strange 1," and nodded with satisfaction. The plot of his house has always been great~ The world of "Vampyr" is small, there is no teleportation point, and it is easy to get lost, but its plot and NPC story are sufficiently substantial. The city is small, but you will find that you are immersed in it. I think it will This game is a good perspective to compare with the Sherlock Holmes series, but I don’t know enough about the Sherlock Holmes series, so I don’t play too much, so I won’t talk nonsense~ Be a self-centered evil spirit, or insist on being a doctor of the world? This is the internal torture that the game gives players throughout. Of course, the protagonist’s level requires experience points. The most convenient one is naturally embracing the citizens (which can be understood as the act of killing), and then doing some tasks, eliminating the cautious behavior of repeated brushing, defeating the enemy and exploring the world The experience reward is really a drop in the bucket. To survive in a world where the mainline enemy can often be several levels or even ten levels higher than you, it is really an interesting test to achieve an ending that does not persecute any citizens-to maintain humanity, you must pay to face huge challenges The price. Summary: Unique and not perfect. Excellent plot, can give players a rethinking worldview and story, superior graphics and soundtrack, but lacking in combat and operability. For players who love open-world reasoning games and don't care about the coolness of battle, it is worth experiencing. Finally, I want to post a sentence from Zhang Yuanshan's "Tongtian Tower": "}

Where it could quickly become boring, provides a pleasant playing feeling. The title has something inexplicable fascinating. Moreover, where the title could quickly irritate, I personally find that the management manages to perfectly balance hatred and soft music. Nonetheless, is a bit ... weird. There is something chaotic about the level architecture, the level “map” doesn't seem to make any sense, and there is an undeniable lack of balance, going from a bewildering level of ease to a bewildering level of difficulty. If the title manages to convey pleasant sensations in the player's body, it also manages to disconcert the player. Despite this labyrinthine dark side, the title has an assuredly perfect quality / price ratio. The title is worth it. Score: 16/20 "}

Cons: - There are a lot of unnecessary items in your inventory, which you use 2-3 times per game. A very controversial flamethrower that I think kills some of the hardcore in the game. - The AI ​​of humans and androids is not impressive. - By the end, the game still becomes not scary, those feelings that were at the beginning are lost.

{"text" : "Sword 'N Board really offers that retro feel that I crave from older games that I played when I was younger. A lot of devs try to pull this off, from downgraded graphics and silly music, but this dev does it right in all aspects. The graphics, for one, is what first had me drawn to this game - the artstyle is incredible and a lot goes into the detail. I have watched the developer stream on Twitch a great many times now, and it's a great experience to see the artwork come to life.  The gameplay is so fun. As a beginner, you may feel as though the game may be too punishing with those first mistakes, because you start off with low stats. Once you get experienced with what you're doing it becomes so rewarding, and you will appreciate all the work you put in to leveling up your character.  At this point, dungeons have started to be introduced in the game. From completing the first one, I cannot wait to play more. As a beginner dungeon it was fun to find all the puzzles hidden within, and offered puzzles that stumped me at first. It alone offered a good deal of content to explore. With it being the smallest dungeon, I know this game will continue to get bigger and better, and with it I will be investing even more time into it. Oh, and item combos? AWESOME. I have never had so much fun with item combos in a game before, lol. Currently, there are just two that I can unlock I believe, and I am just waiting on the edge of my seat to get my hands on more items I can use!  Overall, great gameplay, great artstyle, great music, great combos. And most importantly, a great dev that I have come to respect and support 100%. Keep up the great work- I cannot wait for what's to come. "}
{"text" : "is an online RPG and martial arts game aimed at PvP and PvE. There is no story here, we are just presented with its premise. We were selected for an order of warriors who wear mystical masks, and such masks identify them; these chosen ones fight among themselves to prove their dignities in the elite of the Guides. I wouldn't say the map is open world, but there are several places to visit. During its progression, we will find some pillars that will serve as one, in addition to being the points for accessing the school (I will explain below), and for inviting friends to the game. Remember that interacting with the pillar will restore your life, and the enemies of the place will be reborn. We can face about 12 bosses, some of them have a certain peculiarity, either due to much superior dexterity or strength, combat style, or even facing other enemies at the same time. In addition to them, we will have to venture out, with a very reasonable duration. Now, if you are thinking of getting this game for PvP purposes, forget it unless you have a friend to join, it is practically dead. The RPG elements are present only in the matter of leveling up and obtaining equipment (including new masks). As has been said, the chosen warriors fight each other in order to obtain their titles in the elite of the Guides, so we will face other warriors, not monsters or creatures recurring in an RPG. Upon leveling up, we will gain a skill point to increase one of the basic attributes, which include strength, vitality, dexterity, etc. Some equipment depends on the level of the player to be used, and they affect both positively and negatively on their status. For example, if I end up wearing boots that guarantee more strength and resistance, they will consequently decrease my agility, and so on. The exploration of the scenery is important but very vague, I mean, we will encounter enemies in the middle of the road and everything, but it is very shallow, we only have ceramic vases to break and some stones that will give us a pre-defined item, there is no random generation of them. Combat is the key point, the developers tried to enrich it as much as possible on this aspect. A huge diversity of kicks, punches, and even "feints" are part of the movements that can come from any direction. Of course, combos are common, but balanced in a way, by four-instance mechanics. During the combo we will not be able to repeat the same instance, we always vary it so that each one of them is used. The fourth attack of the sequence in turn has the role of starting another combo, opening a window to new sequences that consist of three attacks. If you defend, deflect or counter an enemy attack, you learn it and can add it to your combos, creating your own variation. We have at your disposal a system of schools, in which the advisor teaches fighting techniques to students, giving them rewards if any objective is reached (you must be at least level 50 in the combat tests to create your own school). there is a school already available within the game to participate, which even guarantees the Bêbado class. Speaking of classes, there are three that are available to choose from when creating your character, in addition to customizing your character as you prefer. They are: The graphics were not made to be realistic, but care was taken with the shadows and soft lighting. The scenarios are aimed at forests, temples and old buildings, with a certain Dark Souls footprint. The soundtrack is exhausting, there is not a good variation, apart from the ambience of the places are also not in agreement. The one is nice and well polished, but I found some. During my walk near a gorge, I ended up but I didn't die, I ran out of options, I had to restart the game. It came a few times too. delivers an interesting fighting experience and technical defects do not completely hinder the work. I'm sorry to say that the campaign for this game should last a maximum of about eight hours if it is well lost, but if you already have a certain notion the duration drops to about three hours. It is relatively short, so if you are going to purchase the title just for that reason I recommend waiting for a 50% discount promotion, considering that it is dead. Curatorial analysis | | "}

Here is why, the character building through the episodes endears Chloe to you, you learn to love her even her flaws, the game on a whole doesn't treat characters as either black and white good or bad, you find yourself digging deep to decide how you will respond to some of the characters depending on your gut feeling of that person which usually is mixed, neither angel or devil, neither fully trustworthy or outright shifty. Like life many options are just either unfortunate or have no win outcome, leaving you feeling cold. Life is Strange shows how good people can do bad things some times, that nothing lasts forever, and that every decision matters.

{"text" : "Cold War, 1980s, you are a general in an underground bunker ... But what I'm starting, you have already read the description and understood what the game is about. This indie strategy, which tried to recreate the game Global Thermonuclear War from the 1983 War Games movie (WarGames, if anyone has heard of it, is quite famous in the West) was popular in the 2000s, I remember how many wrote about it at the time of its release (2006) game magazines, but now, as I see, it is forgotten and I understand why, since the game can offer very little content, the replay value here is very low. But I’ll tell you, because it’s worth talking about. You start the game (against bots or multiplayer) and choose a country (one of six, which is really more territory than a country, but more on that later), you are transferred to a global map stylized for computers of the 80s or under the same screen of the WOPR supercomputer from that movie ... The game is divided into 5 stages (that DEFCON), which are replaced after a certain period of time. But let's talk about this in order: - You start the alignment of forces in the selected country. Place radars that detect enemy units and missiles, place air defense / Missile silos (yes, this is the same structure) that will shoot down enemy planes and missiles, and later launch missiles themselves, airfields from where we will launch planes (fighters and bombers (the latter carry nuclear weapons)), as well as the fleet in the zones indicated by the color of your choice, the fleet consists of cruisers (the main attacking unit), aircraft carriers (floating airfields) and submarines (can be considered the most important ships, because they carry nuclear weapons with them) ... - Units can be moved. - Units (ships, fighters and air defense) can now attack enemy units. - You can use bombers, but no nuclear weapons. - Now the nuclear armageddian is advancing, now the air defense can be converted into missile silos and blast at the cities or facilities of the enemy. It is worth considering that in this mode, they will not be able to shoot down enemy aircraft and missiles, since after all the missiles have been fired, they will return to air defense mode. Also, missile silos are the only ones with an attack radius on the entire map; submarines and bombers have a very limited radius, so they need to come close to cities. For the defeat of enemy cities, you are awarded points, for the defeat of your city, on the contrary, they are taken away. This means that the winner in the end will be the one with the best deal / loss ratio. The atmosphere gives a certain charm to the game, with all the minimalism of the graphics, it is well stylized. Half of the atmosphere is created by music, instead of tension, it is mockingly calm, sometimes replaced by scary or sad notes, it reflects the hopelessness of everything that happens, the end of life in general. Music, coupled with pop-up messages about how many died in a rocket explosion in a particular city, make it clear what you are doing in general. Although you are not limited by anything, the game will put pressure on you morally, clearly showing what your actions lead to with your thirst for victory. One of the scariest games, and it's not even a horror game. And now, to the disadvantages 1. The game sometimes does not start the first time, but this is a fixable and not interfering jamb, with some old games I have this. 2. Reflection of the Cold War, and I'm here specifically about the territory, and here the balance cannot be bought off, it is not here (Europe is dragging), the territories here are divided in a very strange way, for example, the USSR here consists only of the RSFSR, and the republics (Ukraine, the Baltic States, Belarus) were given to Europe, in addition, on the territory of Germany, the line dividing it into the FRG and the GDR is clearly visible, however, it is one, the same with Korea. It's also funny with Asia, stretching from Japan to the Middle East, and no one is embarrassed that China was at war with Japan, South Korea and India. They are here together, period. I would leave the USSR all its republics, and also give it the Warsaw Pact countries and possibly Cuba, and compensate Europe for this with Greenland or Australia that were not involved, the United States would give Mexico (it is also in North America) South Korea and Japan, and I would remove the Middle East and India from China, leaving North Korea and Southeast Asia, or another example, leave Asia as it is, give the United States Mexico and compensate South America with Cuba, so it would be closer to the real situation in the 80s. oh, but alas, we have such a strange distribution that works to the detriment of the atmosphere. In general, I recommend the game, this is the best simulator of nuclear war at the moment, I'm not saying that the best in general, but the best of those that exist now, and I don't remember much strategies about this, unless the SuperPower series.

In short, the game is considered completely about shoot / dodge, where there is practically no effect from the pumping element. But nevertheless, it is worth it to run once in the coop. "}

{"text" : "In my opinion, the game is primarily saved by the character of Geralt. While I can criticize the creation of the side characters a lot, it must be admitted that Geralt corresponds well with his book prototype - well, with the possible exception of promiscuity. Another element that has stood the test of time quite well is the whole world of The Witcher - the universe created by Sapkowski, also in the computer version, is intriguing, although here I consider the success to be half. It has not been possible to fully recreate this perversity known from books, undermining or ridiculing clichés from other fantasy works (and not only). I am also not entirely satisfied with the presentation of the topic of racism. Exposing the senselessness of racial hatred was one of the key themes of the books, and in the game this topic was treated quite superficially. "}

As many others have already written, it is a game similar to "Sims", with a touch of Game Dev Tycoon. I don't want to go into the "story" here, but rather the technical status of the beta. The game is still in beta and you can tell. There are bugs on every corner and edge. And yet the game has this: "Oh come on, just do this quickly", which then doesn't let you finish the game. But despite everything, it's a lot of fun and has a lot of potential and the developers are also up for it, as you can see! Unfortunately, because of the bugs, you have to close and restart the game quite often. My tip for everyone who doesn't really want to do it a second time: just reinstall! That helped me a lot.

{"text" : "Let's talk about Richard Smith. Richard was in my park for a grand total of 15 minutes and 53 seconds, he bought a hot dog and briefly sat on a bench before he got into line to ride Stratosfear. Richie should have probably waited a little longer after eating that hot dog to go thrillseeking, after exiting the coaster he passed multiple restrooms and trash cans to puke right in the middle of the walkway. These things happen, no big deal, so I sent my janitor over and cleaned up the mess. I notice that the Richmeister has gotten back into the line to ride Stratosphere again, that's a bold move. Ricardo finishes his second go on the coaster and he looks rough, completely hunched over and walking slow, I think to myself "thankfully he already puked". Rico stops right at the same spot my janitor just cleaned up after him and purges all over, takes a second step and regurgitates a third time. I don't know what transpired between Dicky and my janitor before they met up at my park on this day but good lord, this janitor better have at least hooked up Rickster's sister to warrant this kind of treatment. People were walking through the bile piles as my poor janitor tried to clean up the mess, after he finished he took a much needed break and I start looking for Ritchie...he's in line again. He can't. There's no way. Rickon finishes the ride and...pukes a fourth time? I coudn't do it to the same janitor, I grabbed a janitor from another Zone for this. Sir Sprays-A-Lot runs, seriously hauls it to the front of the park and finally leaves, maybe his upset stomach was travelling to the basement instead of the penthouse now and he didn't want to do that in a public restroom. I check on the status of my theme park and get to the tab that tells me recent reviews.

{"text" : "Orange moon is a great indie platformer that is a breeze. In the story, the main character is sent by a corporation-employer to a satellite planet in order to conduct reconnaissance, deal with the raiders who live there and experiment with people using alien technologies. But in reality, everything turns out to be far from what it was supposed to ... On an aggressive planet, we will have to fight with local life forms, defensive structures of raiders and even zombie astronauts wandering around the planet with explosives in hand and muttering something incomprehensible. In general, the game quite successfully conveys the atmosphere of the planet - the colors and sound design are ideally combined, the feeling of hopelessness and loneliness on the planet does not leave until the shooting begins. There are several types of weapons in Orange Moon (machine gun, shotgun, rocket launcher, minigun, plasma gun), which will open as artifacts are found on the planet. Also, the main character has a flamethrower, which is only suitable for attacking organic life forms. All weapons, as well as equipment (spacesuit, rocket pack, backpack with grenades, flamethrower) can be improved with pumping kits, or for points that are given for kills. The pumping system is quite simple - damage, volume, number of cartridges. Some weapons in the final stages of pumping can be changed, for example, a second barrel will be added to the machine gun, and cartridges will ricochet from opponents and walls. The ammunition in the game is limited and you need to constantly monitor the number of cartridges, since they are not restored with a new level. If you spend too much ammo on the boss, then the next level can be started with empty ammunition. In extreme cases, cartridges can be purchased in the weapon upgrade menu. The game is quite short, we will need to stay on the moon for 10 days, each of which takes 20-30 minutes. I would like to stay on the planet a little longer or see the continuation of the game ... "}

{"text" : "The game is adapted from the real event "Lu Rongyu No. 2682 Massacre". The overall content is highly restored, thoroughly showing the dark and bloody side of human nature. It is recommended that players check the reported information of related events before playing, and have a deeper understanding of the overall content by understanding the background of the event. The overall story of the one-way ticket takes place on a fishing boat in the Pacific Ocean. This domestic AVG's vertical painting is very good. The city, fishing boat, sea...These factors are all expressed by exquisite illustrations and cutscenes. , And the portrayal of various characters on the horizon is still qualified. The game uses a multiple ending mechanism, but the story content flow is slightly insufficient, and the time for the full ending to play is probably less than 10 hours. The early stage of the game was well prepared, and the sense of substitution was also strong. The opening episode and the sleepless night plot after the protagonist boarded the Horizon successfully caught my eye, and even a little illusion of the opening of the mystery. The production team specially designed a time-limited selection mechanism, but I personally feel that this mechanism is obviously not useful. Because the optional dialogue in this game is obviously insufficient, there are only a handful of places, and even some useless information, which is of little significance to the promotion and direction of the plot. Of course, the shorter game content flow is also to restore real historical events. But it is worth mentioning that the final hidden ending of the game is still very brain-burning and reversed. It is difficult to understand the behavior and motivation of some characters in the game without opening the hidden lines. After the game entered the middle and late stages, the storyline obviously became compact. The extreme lack of interaction between the protagonist and the characters caused the protagonist’s sense of existence to be minimal. Of course, this "no choice" in my opinion is also the one-way ticket game. Features and advantages. It may be really difficult for every crew member on Lurongyu 2682 to have a choice, and everyone is forced to gradually become a bystander. In general, the quality of this game is worthy of its own price, and the content of the game has a high degree of restoration of real events. It is recommended for players who want to understand the Lu Rongyu Incident No. 2682 and explore the dark side of human nature. However, there are a lot of bugs in the early stage of the game, which often crashes and black screens, and the game is produced by the Unreal 4 engine (you read it correctly), you often hear the computer fan spinning at full speed. The post-production team is constantly optimizing, and the optimization of the latest version is also quite good, but the BUG of the achievement system seems to be difficult to fix. The production team always pushes the pot to the steam server. "}

This is not Arkham City, but it's story is way more well-rounded and logical than any of the Rocksteady games. The script actually has some surprisingly well-written moments. For a game like this presentation is important. I needed to put this on 4K with SMAA injected and top settings to get a good image. There are a LOT of jaggies in this game, and 4K is about the only way you will be lessening them. I'm pretty happy overall with the image quality. It's not perfect though, and I wish there was better supersampling, but I'm also not going to complain. I actually prefer the colorized filter. The game looks too drab otherwise, though, it's a decent "Shadows" filter. But it also takes away some of the spirit of the game, and the colors are not overdone anyway. Altogether, this is a solid game, and you should pick up the bundle with the sequel when they are on sale. For under ten bucks for both I can't argue. It's a fun little jaunt in a comic book fantasy.

{"text" : "The game will easily deceive a naive beginner with its external simplicity and primitiveness, but one should not delude oneself. Choose the design and color for the character, or you can leave the default settings. Simple actions of an ordinary runner, combined with an abundance of dangers on the way, await you. The dynamic music of Geometry Dash will accompany your desperate journey against the backdrop of angular landscapes. The developers paid attention to the quality selection of tracks for each level. By listening to these rhythms, you will jump over dangerous spikes and avoid various barriers. Nothing else is required from your cube in Geometry Dash. At first, thorns will be rare, but soon you will become in a panic not to keep up with the appearance of new traps. In Geometry Dash, a brave cube will set out to conquer not only land, but also water. To do this, he transforms into a boat and begins to smoothly maneuver between the reefs. Try to keep it intact and avoid crashing. So much for Geometry Dash. how to play it? Very simple: The principles of a video game, like the method of controlling a hero, are absolutely elementary. Geometry Dash provides you with a track that you race along at insane speeds. There is no chance to consider the obstacles from a distance in advance, and there is only hope that the reaction will be enough to avoid collisions with the deadly thorns. Sometimes the threat lurks over the track, making it difficult to jump high. Dexterity is the only thing that can save the rectangle from death. That's all) "}

{"text" : "In the second game of the masterpiece, we go on a nice adventure with the removal of the technical errors in the first game and with the new graphics engine. We wake up in a hospital and everything starts to reveal from that moment. For example, the sound problem in the first game has been fixed. But now, the animation in the game and the intermediate scene are waiting for us. I liked that it combined with the linear narration with this innovation. I went to play it very excitedly until now. Also, the problem of not having subtitles in the game is solved. You just need to turn on subtitles from the menu. The graphics were a click better than the first game. The improvement of the weather events led to a pleasing and more realistic view. The most important factor of this was the renewal of the graphics engine. However, now we can interact more with the objects. Most of the objects we hit can fall, shake .. The mechanics and physics that I suffered from the first game have been corrected with the new engine in this game. We have a more stable game. With flexible new physics, we experience that pleasure with a more realistic agile movement. We can also say that we glide more beautifully. The deaths of the characters based on this were also nice. Even this game time has attracted me immensely. Do not go without playing ... I do not need to go into the optimization part much, in fact, I got similar performance with the first game. In the directX 8 mode, I got an average of 450-550 in the ultras with rain and 270-300 fps in areas with a little bit of strain. I did not notice any trouble like a bug in the game. I hope not. I express my last view at the end of the game. Edit: The game is now over. So whatever I say, after the first game, the technical errors in the second game are eliminated, the deep meanings in such speeches, the story integrity of the breathless action, so what can I say, Max Payne .. There is no word to say Monaya anyway, the way of speaking attracts those hot looks. We did not run a little, he was chasing it .. I think the character in the second game fits perfectly. I think his face type represents more of the Max Payne character. Of course, we are talking about a game in 2003. It was very good to go between characters and play through their eyes. It was a very good step for the future from that time. The unique moves of Mona and Max Payne are like Mona's making bullet time with less agile movement than Max. But when we come to the cimlastic movement, Mona masha'Allah is super ... Unlike the first game, when you slow down the time here suddenly triple kills or more combos, the camera turns the character into a special It is doing a bullet time action. It was cool, I liked it .. There is a situation that does not improve technically, although there is not much problem, you cannot play the game above 1080p as in the first game. These were the things that came to my mind. I would definitely say don't miss it. Good games .. "}

{"text" : ""Entropy: Zero" invites you to feel in the shoes of an Alliance soldier who, by coincidence, is stuck in the dying city of "City 10". Everywhere is devastation and traces of war, in which, apparently, everyone lost. Our character, frankly, is an unpleasant creature. And this is manifested not only in sarcastic phrases like "People suck", which he lets out about the rebels he killed, but also in the narrative itself. The first half of the game we have to literally exterminate the rebels, and "gnaw" our way through the mountains of corpses. The author of this review often felt like a soulless villain in the worst sense of the word, killing innocent defenders (and even wounded) people. In the second half of the game, the literal one is added to the psychological gloom: the player gets into the subway, and from that moment the famous phrase from the movie "Taxi 3" becomes more relevant than ever. It's hard to say anything specific about the plot, as it is presented mainly through the gameplay and atmosphere. By the end of the game, understanding of what (and why) is happening may disappear, but this will not interfere with the main part of the passage. Our hero is fully consistent with other representatives of his "species" - the same negative and cruel character. This can be justified by the fact that he is trying to survive, but not really, and I want to somehow justify him. The atmosphere is very well developed here, and perhaps this is the main "highlight" of the game. Devastation and decay is felt at every step until the final location. The music is at the highest level, in the style of the "Half-life" series. The gameplay was the most controversial. Focusing on the atmosphere, the developer went too far with lighting, or rather, lack of it. At first, this can still be tolerated, because, fortunately, our hero has a night vision device with a capacious battery. When the player gets on the subway, patience starts to run out. But when the life-saving night vision device is taken away from the player in this very subway, slipping a slow, helpless stalker as lighting, life becomes sad. The stalker moves in tiny steps, nothing is visible, enemies come up / run up / creep up from all sides (which can even kill the player with one or two blows, not to mention our "companion") - the situation is not pleasant. The moment with the stalker can be safely included in the textbook on how to push the player away from his game. The funny thing is that the difficulty of the game is prohibitive, and the settings do not help much. Even any rebel can lay down our hero with two or three hits. Combined with what is happening in the metro, it turns out a nuclear mixture for those who like to tickle their nerves and patience. Should the sky-high complexity of the game be considered a plus? At the beginning and end of the game, yes. In the middle - more likely no than yes, because the lack of normal visibility is more of a developer's miscalculation than a test for the player. The mod is definitely definitely recommended for passing. Everything you can expect is here. After many conflicting reviews, the author of the mod decided to rework the difficulty and, in particular, the level with the stalker. He will have to try very hard to even out the balance, and, at the same time, not turn the game into a casual adventure and shooting range for beginners. Well, fans can only wait and hope that the endless respawn of enemies in some places will also not go unnoticed. Perhaps some of the claims of this review will soon cease to be relevant, but will remain as a reminder. "}

The plane crashed in the middle of the ocean where the lighthouse was located? Our GG floats to this lighthouse, going inside, we go down to the basement, where there is a bathysphere, which takes us to an underwater city (or the state, she knows it) called "Delight" (aha, of course). This entire city (or state) is mired in anarchy, where two groups of Rhine and Fontaine are fighting, which are fighting for power in Rapture. The game gradually tells us about the history of "Rapture" in the form of cassettes that are scattered throughout the game and will meet you. Some of them are story-driven. What about the gameplay? It is essentially a shooter, but not ordinary. The game, in addition to firearms and the only cold weapon, provides us with some "plasmids". In a medieval fantasy world, it would be called magic. But no, this is not magic, this is reality in Bioshock. Thanks to them, in addition to shooting enemies with a Thompson, we can burn them, freeze them (and beat them with a wrench), throw them into the ceiling, send a horde of bees, brainwash them, forcing them to shoot with each other. There is also a system for hacking cameras, turrets, safes and more. This hack does not shine with a variety, so we have to be content with the same mini-game about a mixture of a plumber and an electrician - to deliver current through pipes to the point we need. What can I say about the final boss? What the developers gave us at the end of the game is pizdec. It feels like the boss was just made on pohui. His body is under 2.5-3 meters in height, looks like a jock who sits on steroids. His whole body looks like it is some kind of walking coal that can be mined in minecraft. The most combat with him was realized just awfully, as if there was not enough budget for him. Fight with big daddy seemed to me more interesting and more difficult than this coal bull, which runs like ebanutyi along a straight path, from which it is easy to dodge. Three endings are implemented here - 1 good and 2 bad. Without knowing it, I achieved a good ending from the game (which is not difficult enough). All the endings are implemented well, I think I was even moved when I saw the ending, and got some pleasure from it, after all these tedious shootings in the game. Even despite 2020. the game looks pretty good, if I wanted to, I would like to replay it again. 9 big daddies out of 10 little sisters. "}

It killed the whole atmosphere and this is at the most difficult level of the game without the Typhon abilities. And most importantly the plot! He's cool, until the last screensaver when you realize.

{"text" : "Help those who make this game seriously, because survival games are one of the most preferred games, especially when playing with your friends. "}
{"text" : "This game has great ideas, but overall feels unfinished.  The crafting system is fun but slow. However that in the end it's worth it, because after all the grueling craft grind, manually doing everything... you eventually get a building from the story that changes your Portia crafting life. Honestly it may have taken a bit longer than one would like to get to that point. For example the research center feels more like a place to harass for recipes and they take entirely too long to get back to you with those. Forces you to hang out and do nothing. The ranching is worthless. You can buy everything you get from them in the store really early. The farming feels forced. Once you get a helper you don't even pay attention to fertilizer anymore. You get a few crafting materials from certain plants and that's pretty much the only planters I have. It's also ugly to look at. The crafting machines were like that too but you can stuff them in the factory later. Leveling takes an ETERNITY. With how many hours I have in, I still have to go to Phyllis and get acupunctures constantly to reset my points to redistribute. Those sessions add up in money. The romantic interests are bland with only a few that seemed to get special treatment (cough ARLO cough). Those special ones even have their own quest routes and cutscenes. While others get shafted only just asking you to marry them wherever you decided to talk to them and having no real change in their normal behavior. Some of them have no voice lines outside of the story.  Speaking of the story.. it was ok. Nothing bad to say about it. The characters in town reacted to every new change. It gave me some direction, so no complaints. Your building rival is has a one dimensional personality and you quickly feel bad for him rather than actually want to compete. The cutscene animations were TERRIBLE. Their mouths would move too slow, too fast or not at all when they were talking. The movements were awkward and robotic. Some characters would try to blink but their eyelids wouldn't quite make it. Hey at least the music is good.  The clothes! Some were nice but I wish the hats didn't change your hair! Thank goodness for the ability to change an equips appearance with another, but sometimes the hat looks adorable or really good with the only qualm being the forced hair change. Also some skirts had cloth physics but others did not. Not sure why they only did half of them. The battle system is a real time hack and slash. It's actually pretty fun, but kind of slow in terms of reaction speed and you can often bug out the monsters with your weapons. I'm looking at you hammer. It can feels clunky at times and really good at others. The bosses are typically just move spammers based off how far or close you are. Once you figure that out, it's easy peasy. Everything just feels half complete. I heard rumours of a new addition to the series and I hope they spend more time ironing out things. I would still recommend this game to people who enjoy crafting type sims. It's a great time sink plus you get more than you would expect. Even if there's some issues. "}

{"text" : "As a true fan of this series, I've got to say that this first installment to the series is the best one in it. I had originally played this masterpiece on Xbox 360 and hoping that it would get ported to PC and here it is. The port is extremely well executed, it offers surprisingly smooth keyboard and mouse experience and of course controller support along with customizable keyboard binds and graphics options. The game ran solid 60 FPS throughout my whole playthrough without crashing. The good old stuff that this port brings along with it are some of the clunky mechanics, occasional bad AI, constant race against time, character progression, amazing soundtrack, FANTASTIC bosses(psychopaths) and interesting story with multiple endings. After completing the main playthrough you can work on your 2nd playthrough to level up Frank to the max level or to hop on to infinity mode, which is tons of fun and adding a lot of play value. If you have ever played this game on the Xbox 360 and you enjoyed it, this is a fantastic nostalgia ride for only 19,99 €, totally worth it! "}

{"text" : "The game has an extremely beautiful universe, special characters and an interesting plot. There are several locations that we go in search of "our" uncle. The developers have managed to give each its own unique atmosphere and incredible beauty. Flying between the islands, you always want to look around. Of course, the complexity of movement also changes: if at first there is nothing difficult, then as you pass you will have to spend more and more time in the air and fly huge (by the standards of the game) distances. The characters here are fun and cheerful, they are interesting to watch (although they do not do anything special). But for the whole game we will have to interact with only 2-3 of them. The plot is presented in the form of a story that the father tells his daughter at bedtime. It looks very harmonious and adds zest to the game. The gameplay of the game is nothing special: there is a "super-suit" that allows you to jump high, fly a little, cling to different surfaces and fall from great heights without damage. Everything is built on flights between the islands, and in another - a typical "get from point A to point B". And there is one bug (idea?), Which brought me a whole group - the distance at which you can hook the surface is sometimes very different. If it is rough - in one case the hook gets on 15 meters, and in another on hardly on 5 meters. And so you jump with the thought "well, I'll get here for sure", but just fall into the abyss =) Somewhere in the middle of the game it starts to tire of the monotony of movement, but then flights to the same "giant distances" begin, the game challenges again and you are captive again his "I can do it". Conclusion: the game is definitely worth a try. Especially for lovers of adventure, interesting stories and just unusual beautiful entertainment. "}

Everyone wants renewal, variety, etc. So I want to ask you what do you want in a game that requires team play and skill? The point is that the game doesn't need to change much. This game is mainly made for esports. And in this game, skill is evenly important. Well, operations rarely come out, but still they are and will be. Skins are still being introduced because there is nothing to add, nothing more is needed. Basically, they change the details of the gameplay, for example, the new beeping of the bomb. You don't need to add new weapons or something like that, no one is playing on new maps. There was even a new wave of VAK bans. So the game didn’t slip. But I have no idea why online falls ... "}
{"text" : "Without a doubt Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a marvel. - Currently has a good variety of trucks and modifications for them. (With the modifications offered by the workshop you can have a very good variety of trucks) - I use the keyboard and driving is quite pleasant. Although when giving small curves or the micro corrections that must be done on the road it is something annoying at times. - The cities in this game are not gigantic by any means, but they do manage to have the same scenery, although in a low quantity. - Long trips are the best of ETS2. Watching the vegetation change, the roads themselves, passing more toll booths, and the traffic signs gives you that feeling of "realism". - The DLC undoubtedly give life to the game, especially the expansion of the maps ... it is well worth paying for them. I don't really like tuning so much, but that is already a matter of each one. - There is a good amount of trailers, you have from carrying a traditional tank to a nuclear reactor, there are many merchandise in ets2. - As I said before, the gameplay is quite nice even with the keyboard, although it has its flaws - I find the graphics correct, although on some occasions, the water looks very strange. Anyway, if I could say something bad about this game it would be from the online people, but that is already a mod and it depends on each one to want to play it or not. If I had to put notes on it, it would be like this: Gameplay: 7/10 Sound: 7/10 Graphics: 8/10 Content: 10/10 Durability: 9/10 "}

{"text" : "Should I get a Dying Light? Listen to the theme song and if it impresses you, you have your answer. I will always remember Dying Light as one of my best series, because I was at the bottom of my energy at the time of filming, but each subsequent episode was well received. If I should be brief - it saddled me like a pot on my ass. Maybe it's the great parkour system, maybe the atypical location of the game, maybe even the successful soundtrack, which beautifully underlines your despair and abandonment. For me, however, these were situations like this. After five hours of sleep, you finally turn on the game in the evening and find that you are on the roof of the building far from a safe hiding place. Of course, there is pitch black darkness around you and it is brutally raining. A few floors below you, a flame burns directly from the container and you can hear the unnatural roar of a toothy bastard coming out only at night and going anywhere for you. You will start a frantic escape and thanks to a good dose of luck you will get to the safety and community of other survivors. Time to snore, because tomorrow goes for the duck. It's a real pleasure to see that the creators made a hell of a big leap forward from Dead Island. Although I didn't feel the atmosphere, danger and urgency of the story so much on the second and third finishes, on the first pass it was really a full-fledged zombie survival journey and by far the biggest surprise of 2015. PS: Cooperation adds another portion of fun and kicking zombies with a partner down from the bridge is an ass for a long time, however it is more suitable for titles that are not taken very seriously, such as Dead Rising. If you have time, first walk through Dying Light nicely solo and cut the second finish with a friend. The experience will always be different. "}

{"text" : "Really short game that originated as what it seemed to be parody of the genre back in 2013 for free only for Windows only in Japanese. In the end it got a Steam version remade with Unity with official translations, multiplatform support and Steam goodies such as cloud saves, achievements and trading cards/backgrounds/emoticons. The only missing things are the lack of soundtrack and gallery (even in-game), which would be a nice addition to complete it, but overall it's a really neat re-edition for the price. "}

If you can't get laid, find a girlfriend, or your women simply doesn't want to marry you..  Then fear not, this is the game you are looking for!  9 out of 10, you will chat with other men pretending to be a women, then.. You'll hook up and both are having fun infront of their screens. So be sure to check off being a bisexual, cause really.. The only thing that is happening are two males masturbating while clicking their dirty keyboards and mouse trying to roleplay.  Don't get too excited and make your keys sticky. You can even work as a prostitute and get free gifts by other freaks.  However, if you can get laid IRL and you live a normal life, good for you!  Then i wouldn't download this, it is for perverts with too much time and a wallet the size of a male pornstars ♥♥♥♥. Nada in this game is free except for like a few things. But hey, they got poker. It's real cool, it works as it should and... wait. Never mind, they even perverted poker by having us strip.. Don't download. But then again, who the f is normal here.

{"text" : "This game is not what people would expect from trailers, but if you haven't seen them, you'd better not look at them, because the game is short and they basically spoil it for you. The visual rendering of the game is one word BOMB !! The sound in the game is Phenomenal, if you have good headphones or boxes with surround sound, it will come in handy (when you walk through the darkness and go for the voice, which will take you out of the darkness). For those who are waiting for a combat system similar to Dark souls, the game will probably be a disappointment. The battles are generally easy. There is no Game + option after you finish playing it multiple times and on greater difficulty. A big minus with my parties and at the same time a disappointment for me is the length of the game (too short) A big plus - I like to fish screens and here is something to take pictures and he just won't let go. The start of the game is slower only by puzzles and almost no fights ... please do not be discouraged by the end of the game will make up for everything. For 30 €, the game is worth 75% for me and I would give even more, but the fact that it is so short is down.

{"text" : "Spyro, Spyro, you little cute dragon, be our lovely hero and paragon. Spyro Reignited Trilogy is a remaster of 3 games, originally published between 1998 and 2000: Spyro the Dragon, Ripto's Rage! and Year of the Dragon. The game, the layout of the levels everything stayed the same and I must say it is better that way. The only and most significant change is the way the game looks. It became beautiful. The game itself focuses on being as cute as possible. The young and little Spyro is extremely adorable, who is full of willingness to save the world. His determination is strong and it is well visible on his face, which turns into a grim, determined look as he charges toward his foes. While there are many enemies to defeat, they’re not so much deadly foes. Even bosses could be handled easily on first try with a few exceptions. Getting all gems, collectibles, finishing minigames or timed races are more challenging. Don’t be afraid, they are not too hard. The challenge is just enough to have some satisfaction, when, for example, reaching a gem which was visible from a far distance and got to there after discovering a secret path or successfully gliding to it. In the first game Spyro travels from world to world freeing dragons imprisoned by the evil Gnasty Gnorc. In Ripto’s Rage, our hero learns some new mechanics, swimming etc. Spyro just wanted some holiday after all the work he needed to do in the first episode but found just another foe. This time we need to collect talismans, orbs and each of them awarded for various challenges. In Year of the Dragon, Spyro and friends must rescue dragon eggs stolen by an evil sorceress. Friends is an important word in the previous sentence, as this time you can control other characters too, once unlocked, as many levels have areas you can explore only with one of the 4 other playable characters: Sheila the Kangaroo, Sgt. Byrd, Bentley the Yeti, and Agent 9 the Monkey. Spyro Reignited Trilogy is a great game and highly recommended. Platformer games are not my favourite but I really liked this one.  Interesting characters, funny stories, just what you need to cheer yourself up after work/school.  It is unclear, if anyone would replay this once completed everything to 100%, it is still possible and not a bad move to replay it again after a few years.   A decent entertaining platformer, for all ages. Its goal is to entertain and Spyro is not going to fail you. You will be enchanted.  Beautiful, cartoony, fantasy landscapes and cute characters.  quality music/sound effects, to make the world of the dragons even more magical and you can switch to the original music from 1998.  Cute and charming voices.  Not a roguelike or soulslike, just a chilling platformer with some challenges. Perfection time: ~35-40 hours. Every single world has one level specific achievement and you need to finish every game to 100%. Some challenges included but perfection is far from being impossible. "}

{"text" : "Whatever they say, but the zombie business has lived, lives and will live. Dead Island is a vivid example of combining two unconnected elements: a beautiful, sunny island, a real paradise on earth and hordes of ugly dead people eager to devour all living things on their way, have not been exposed to the virus that kills all living things and revives all the dead, but they must find their way out of this hell, hiding under the guise of paradise. The island itself is an open world, divided into separate locations. You can go from one point to another on your own, use transport or special teleport points. On the way, evil spawns of an unknown virus await us. Zombies roam everywhere, and sometimes not only ordinary ghouls. can catch up with you in a matter of seconds or dodge a blow, others spit poison or smash into the ground in one fell swoop. Thus, the journey turns into a game with death, where only you have to survive. The rest have already died and take revenge on all living things. Although, as practice shows, rare scattered handfuls of people remain on the island, some help, others sometimes turn out to be worse than the dead. There is only one conversation with them - a bullet in the forehead and food for hungry zombies. In addition to the main storyline, there are side quests, for the completion of which they are given various bonuses and money. Graphics, comparable to Crysis, not only pleasing to the eye, but also does not squeeze all the juices out of your computer. The game runs stably even on medium systems. In general, if you are a fan of zombie shooters and apocalypses of this kind you like Dead Island will suit your taste. "}

{"text" : "From the very first launch, it makes an incredible impression. First of all, it is the unique atmosphere of a dark Slavic fantasy with a perfectly created living world. The main character, Geralt, once again sets off on an adventure, this time in search of his adopted daughter Ciri, and these very searches lead him to a variety of places full of events, adventure, and of course, magic. First, let's talk about the graphics and the world itself. The nature here is very believable. The forest has generally been worked out like no other game. Sunsets and sunrises are mesmerizing and make you stop to see in detail how the sun's rays fall on the surrounding fields and forests. And what are the only villages inhabited by fishermen, hunters, plowmen, merchants, and, of course, drunkards. Their models, their behavior in the game, and what is really there, the curses uttered by them allow you to completely immerse yourself in this atmosphere and play without any distractions. Separately, I would like to admire the location of Tusent from the "blood and wine" add-on. You feel yourself in some Italian village with its unhurried life, wine cult and sultry summer. However, it’s not that simple. We see that the huts are dilapidated, the population is poor, and often women cry bitterly right at their doorstep. Such are the dire consequences of the Northern Kingdoms' war with Nilfgaard. Despite the fact that the game is sometimes dominated by a bright, sunny picture, which, it would seem, does not fit into the atmosphere of bloodshed, in fact it only enhances the contrast between the beauty of nature and the ugliness of the warrior. And now, I want to talk about the most important thing in this game - the Plot. If you have already played the previous parts, then this part is required for familiarization. If not, play them, because in order to simply retell the entire plot of the previous parts and the plot. If we talk about the plot of the third part as a whole, it is great. Given that the game was created in the RPG genre, it is difficult to say something new here (after all, there are certain laws of the genre). After completing the game, you want to erase your memory again and again in order to see everything that happened on the screen for the first time. At the same time, the game does not become an interactive movie with the gameplay "press x, now y, and now x x x y", which is very important. And even despite the fact that the main character in the game is unchanged and cannot be customized in his own image and likeness, the player can still influence the course of events. In this he is helped by the presence in the dialogues of several options for answers, which sometimes do not have a correct or incorrect solution and only you will think what Geralt will do, and you can be sure that this will be reflected in the future. The presence of 3 endings in the main plot only confirms this. Both the storyline and the side quests have some incredible energy. This is one of those games where the dialogues between the characters do not want to waste. In addition, an important component is that the game still describes Slavic mythology, which, after all, is much closer to us. In the Witcher, all dialogues are extremely simple and straightforward, are perfectly integrated into the plot and are very funny in places. Sometimes there is a lot of humor and a lot of sadness in them, which makes the game very vital, not dividing it into black - white, evil-good. Geralt himself, in one case, can act like a hero, and in another, like a cold-blooded killer. I cannot objectively assess the combat system, since took place at the minimum level of difficulty, not particularly bothering about where and what needs to be pumped. At the same time, for me personally, even so it is interesting to fight. It is very cool to look at the various somersaults of Geralt and his opponents, among whom there are a lot of both people and all kinds of evil. Bottom line: the game is a masterpiece, mandatory for everyone, without exception. "}

{"text" : "How to spoil the reputation of a console masterpiece? Very easy, forget about the fact that the game has no regional protection, port it to the PC, not giving a damn about its technical jambs. Voila! We receive "Mixed" reviews. Only the unfinished game is worse than the transferred game. However, the developers rolled out 3 patches, which generally fixed the main problems of the game, but an unpleasant aftertaste, in the form of a 3 times higher price, still remained. Yeah ... the game started very badly and I almost gave up playing it, but as the patches were released, the situation improved and my opinion changed for the better. Therefore, let's talk about the game itself ... The game introduces us to a little girl named Aloy, she and her mentor (in fact, he is like a father to her) live in a world that has survived, for unknown reasons, the apocalypse and returned to its primitive state. It would seem that the first, console version of Far Cry: Primal? Nooo ... In the game there is something that is far from the primitive world, what is a feature of its setting - these are robots, do not understand where they came from and populated every corner of the game world. All of them are deadly and very aggressive, even though they outwardly resemble some animals, which by their nature do not touch people. So, our mentor, whose name is Rast, must teach Aloy the basics of survival in this harsh world. The social status of our heroes adds to the problems, they are Outcasts. However, one day, Aloy learns that there is a certain initiation ritual that will help her break out of this vicious circle of contempt from the people around her. But, on such a long-awaited day, something happens that changes Aloy's life forever - a series of events that shows us that Aloy's destiny is much more than just breaking out of the Outcast caste, much more than going through the Initiation. Why did the apocalypse happen? Where did these countless machines come from and who are their creators? Who are the parents of the main character? Aloy will find answers to these and many other questions in a huge, once forbidden world for her, in the ruins of a once prosperous civilization. The journey begins! Since the game positions itself as an Action / RPG, it implies an open world, and we all know what an open world RPG is, it's a lot of loot, epic mixes with enemies, merchants, character leveling and weapons, in general, the exploration of the world in all of it beauty. The game has something to do, in addition to a very interesting plot, we are offered many side tasks, which may not be so interesting, and sometimes are built according to hackneyed cliches, but still necessary in terms of studying the present and past world and the people inhabiting / inhabiting it ... You can also hone your fighting machine skills in the Hunting Grounds. Regarding the combat system itself, consider it not here, I mean that there are no blocks of parries and counterattacks, the battle with machines, roughly speaking, is reduced to firing from long-range weapons (bow, slingshot, slingshot), spear strikes at close distances, and rolls from enemy attacks. The game also offers stealth-passing battles: we hide in tall grass, set traps, or beat hostile NPCs with silent attacks. Personally, I preferred to "resolve all issues" the old fashioned way, with noise and explosions: D By the way, it is interesting that the skills in the leveling tree are more conducive to passing the game in stealth mode than in the open, most likely this is help to those who play on hardcore. The whole world is divided into 3 biomes: forest, desert and winter. So, they all look just amazing and give out as juicy picture as possible. Photo mode makes it possible to make a bunch of beautiful screenshots, with different filters and angles. In HZD, nature is replete with its beauty, believe me, it is probably more beautiful only in Ghost of Tsushima. This game is designed to be played in 4k resolution, and with the tracks that accompany us all the time, it’s like playing a movie. In addition to visuals, I believe that music creates the lion's share of the atmosphere here. Technical mistakes made during the release on Steam, specifically spoiled the impression of HZD for all players. It's up to you to buy this game for a full price or wait for a discount, at the moment the game is very playable, but it requires quite powerful hardware to keep a more or less stable frame. If you are initially negatively disposed towards this game, in the light of recent events, then I immediately advise you to pass by, most likely you will not get pleasure. Personally, I am very pleased that it finally appeared on the PC and you can go through it yourself. To buy a game in order to meticulously seek out shoals is not mine. In any game they are, any developers will ever make mistakes :) "}

No Let's Plays, no guides, none until you have beaten it at least once, and only accept hints on how to progress, no searching on how the ending goes. It is how you can get the maximum experience. If a game manages me to do so much research 'cause there's so many things about it that you need to know to uncover its true lore, and even managed to make me attempt to write a fanfic of it, then it's doing a really good job. I haven't done one of the runs of the game so far, but that is only because I don't have the heart to attempt it. I... don't want to have a bad time...

{"text" : "Easily the most under-rated game of the year and another comeback for turn based JRPG's. It perfectly incorporates classic elements from the genre such as traditional turn based combat, a diverse and loveable cast of characters, a beautiful art style and the "Hero's Journey" story pattern. However it evolves these elements into something more modern and fitting for a large 3D world. The transition is outstanding and is what future JRPG's should take notes from. Dragon Quest XI is huge, my first playthrough spanned around 95 hours, but kept me invested all the way through. Consisting of three major acts that each take drastic turns for the plot. Like all Dragon Quest games, the story is very tropey but I find that's one of the most lovable aspects of the game. One of the strongest elements is the graphical design and animation. Cutscenes are fluid and full of life and there are hundreds of detailed and beautifully animated monsters to battle. This time however, there are no random encounters, every monster will appear on the overworld and you decide whether you will take them on. This is a deviation from the typical random battle system that's almost too common in JRPG's. Another of my favourite elements is the diversity in each of the many different regions of Erdrea. Every town and city is inspired by a country or culture from the real world. For example: Gallopois is inspired by Egypt, Hotto by Japan, Gondolia by Italy, Arboria by Greece, and Honolulu by Hawaii etc. This makes every major location feel fresh and interesting. Not to mention the great work done by the English localisation team on translating and coming up with some great puns for monster names and dialogue. English voice acting is present and is generally really good. Because of this, the main characters have great chemistry when interacting with eachother. This is something that I always appreciate in lengthy JRPG's so this makes the entire experience much more enjoyable.  I do have my fair share of issues, especially with how some of the later parts of the story are handled but they definitely don't detract too much from my overall love for this game. The only other major problem I have is how the soundtrack is handled in-game. Dragon Quest XI does have an orchestrated soundtrack but it isn't included in the game itself. Instead the composer made it exclusive to a physical album and left the game with a synthesized MIDI version of the game's soundtrack instead. This was a horrible decision and the in-game music suffers greatly from it. However, there is a brilliant mod that I highly recommend, as it replaces every track with the orchestrated version. It sounds phenomenal in comparison and will absolutely make the game much more enjoyable for you. I highly encourage JRPG fans and newcomers to give this game a chance because it 100% deserves one. The series deserves a lot more attention and love than it's currently getting outside of Japan. "}

{"text" : "Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands review by Kurz For Onono - Gamers Connect. All reviews is also available at:  10/10 Introduction Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands, by Ubisoft Paris and published by Ubisoft, was released on March 7, 2017. Wildlands is the 10th game in the series but the first Ghost Recon game to go with the open world concept. It is one of the biggest open world maps that Ubisoft has ever created. Gameplay The game starts off in the high mountains of Bolivia. At first, you get drawn into the awesome graphics that surround you, complete with detailed and nicely made terrain, trees, grass, and so on. It’s purely breathtaking. When you start off, you get three bots to play with, or you can choose to play with friends in co-op. If you choose to play in coop, the bots will disappear. Ghost Recon Wildlands is played in a 3rd person perspective, but you have the option of taking on a first person view as well. You play as a member of the Delta Company, and your task is to retake control of Bolivia. Your target is the druglord El Sueño, who is running the biggest drug cartel in the world, and it’s up to you and or your friends to take him Down. There are different difficulties you can put on to make the game easy or extremely challenging. I would recommend putting it has high as you can tolerate, since it will increase the amount of fun you have in the game. There is nothing like sneaking up to a base and silently take out the entire force who are armed with a high skill set. I would recommend if you are playing with friends that you put your difficulties at the same as your friends. That will force you to play the same tactics. Doing missions in the dark compared to daytime makes a big difference in how you plan your entry. During the night, you have the advantage of stealth. Many of the soldiers are also sleeping during the night, making them an easy target. Drones are your best friend in the game. You can easily scout an entire base within a minute to plan your attack. The first of the drones have fewer abilities, but as you progress and get the experience required, you can upgrade your drone to be quicker and stronger. There is a wide variety of weapons, clothing, and ways to customize your equipment. Ghost Recon Wildlands uses weapons from different militaries around the world. As you progress in your game, you will find and unlock new guns, add-ons, clothing, and vehicles. Helicopter is my main way of transportation, and the sweet thing is that you can spawn in any vehicle wherever you are on the map, making it easy to travel. You can also teleport to different locations you have unlocked on the map, or you can teleport to any of your friends. The map is huge and is divided into 21 areas. The different areas have different difficulties, meaning it’s best to start out with the lower levels. When you enter a new area, you unlock new missions to complete. The missions in the different areas are controlled by a Buchon, and to progress towards eliminating them, you need to take out the underbosses. Cutscenes for the story are well made, and Karen Bowman is as bad as you can get. Spoiler alert: pressuring cartel members to overdose on coke to makes them squeal. Special Operations Ubisoft has done a lot to support the game over the years. They have made several special operations to keep players like me playing the game continuously. There are currently five special operations: Predator Operation Watchman Operation Archangel Operation Silent Spade Operation Oracle DLC There are 2 DLCs for Ghost Recon Wildlands: Narco Road and Fallen Ghosts. They both take place on self-sustaining maps- both edited parts of the original map. The gameplay is a little bit different from the original game, but they both have some interesting new implements. For example, the way your vehicles and planes are made so much more arcade-like in Narco Road to the awesome new enemies you encounter in Fallen Ghost. I would recommend them both, but I wish they had made the DLCs’ maps expand into the main map. Conclusion If you want to get an awesome shooter game with cooperative gameplay, there is no way around Ghost Recon Wildlands. It is the best Coop game out there to date, even if it’s some years old. The world of Wildlands is so beautiful, you can just drive around enjoying the view. 10/10 Pros - Amazing open world - Fun to play with friends - Almost unlimited ways to edit guns, skins and clothing - Long campaign - Great story Cons - Helicopters may spawn but not where you wanted - DLCs are not an extension of the original map - You need a lot of free time to play it - Can be repetitive to some degree - Desolated places have little content Written by Kurz Please follow our reviewer`s at our Steam Curator page: Our link to Friend & Foe in discord is:  Steam group link: "}

{"text" : "The campaign is one of the best I have played in the series, since it is the most personal in terms of characters, it is about companionship. In addition, they add new mechanics before seen in the saga, there is no regeneration of life for example, you must heal yourself with medical kits that you find, otherwise all the weapons feel good, and are competent worthy of the classic World at War. Unfortunately the story ends without unraveling the Second World War, at no time is any historically characteristic Nazi leader seen, instead WaW focuses less on the characters and more on the demolition of Nazi Germany, but it is also true that it has the campaign of Japan, which occupies 50% of the game and in my opinion is counted by way of filler, which WW2 does not have and also focuses 100% on the Nazi theme, which for my taste is more interesting. The infiltration mission in which you manage Camille Rousseau seems to me one of the best in the saga, it reminded me of when you managed Elizabeth in the Bioshock Infinite, and I loved that. "}

Over time, I climbed the wiki, watched the guides and understood how to play. When I just started playing after everything I learned, I was very addicted this game and I could not come off. When I was able to kill 1 boss itself, I was very happy and after that I became even more interested in playing this game. When I killed her prashol, I got everything I could. I decided to see if it was possible to play it with friends. ... And as soon as I found out that you can play, I started looking for friends who love Terraria like me.

The other character, born with you, is dying to come to the house you will set up. You can get information about the game from this NPC, but since the things you will learn are very general, you may have difficulty in Terraria at first. For this reason, you will notice that when you enter the game, it is not very friendly for first-time beginners because it does not contain information resources about the operation of the game and the production chain. You need to learn all of these yourself or research them on websites. You get used to the general gameplay after a short time and you become addicted quickly, so there are not many problems in the learning part, but you will feel the lack of necessary information about production throughout the game. Throughout the game, you strive to produce the most advanced items, and therefore not being able to see how to produce them is one of the game's biggest annoyances (the number of weapons alone exceeds 50). "}
{"text" : "This is a very hard game to review.  Mainly because I feel most people are expecting a comparison between this and its successor- day of defeat:source. I love both of these games to death, but the similarities are few and far between. Obviously source has better graphics, but the maps and communities are nearly polar opposites.  Day of Defeat is much harder than its Source counterpart. Mainly because of the source engine itself. DoD has a very weird sense of physics. So weird in fact, it's hard to explain. Your weapons are widely inaccurate when you're moving in nearly any form (which is expected) but the time it takes to stop moving is hard to get used to. Jumping feels right, sprinting feels good, but they're both limited by a short energy bar. I have no problem with this whatsoever- it makes sense to me that they'd put a lot of realism into that.  The gunplay is, for lack of a better word, nice. The guns aren't pretty by any stretch, but this is an old game, stop complaining about it. They aren't hard to handle like Counter Strike, but they feel real. Killing an enemy takes a lot of effort, but gunfights are ended quickly because of how damn powerful your weapons are. In a military shooter like this one, that feeling is essential. I don't wanna feel like I'm walking around weilding nothing more powerful than a squirt gun with hot sauce in it. The popularity of this game has sparadically decreased since its release, but thats expected. Whereas most people have moved on to Source, there's still very much a community that thrives here. Most of them for the nostalgia, but a good part of them have joined because they're looking for something new. Veterans here are very common (not war veterans, guys.) and you could tell that this was a piece of their childhood. I'm being serious. Some of these guys joined steam way back when it was made. Are they good at the game? Oh my god. I'm lucky that I walked out of spawn sometimes. What's my personal verdict? I feel like this is a relic. Something everybody should experience at some point in time. That's not that ridiculous- especially considering this game is so cheap off-sale anyway. It's hard to get the hang of, but damn do you ever feel good afterwards. Sadly, though, at the end of the day I do prefer the Source version. I hold both of these close to my heart as milestones of my slow transition into PC gaming. "}

{"text" : "An excellent battle royale is finally in Steam! This game has brought a breath of fresh air to dull and gray rat simulators, battles can last a long time, but dynamic! Nobody, of course, cancels the fact that you can not meet anyone at the rink, but what is the chance of this situation? Let's go through the obvious pluses of Nut: 1) Legends and their lore - Characters have different abilities, but at the same time they are balanced, there are no strong or weak, there are those who can be found by their style of play, my favorite is still Octane. I love to quickly get out of the mess or catch up with weakened enemies. Lore is not written boringly, it is interesting to read it and delve into what and how! Plus to the lore I will also include videos that are similar in style to Human Pavuk: through the Universes. The video looks great! Respect for developing lore! 2) Cannons - there will be no boring and boring M'ochek and Kalash, no digles, the weapon is completely invented and balanced, which is quite difficult to do. There are, of course, frankly weak guns (Mozambique or pistol), but at the beginning you will be happy about that too! In terms of balance, I meant that there will be no domination by snipers or under-door shotguns, everyone plays as they feel comfortable, and not as the best barrel. 3) Skins - Not only does the Battle Pass contain beautiful skins, it also pays off (hello, bydlosoft), for every few levels that you pump yourself you will still receive an in-game container with random clothes. What's more cool - some skins change the weapon model. Of the minuses, I can only note a large number of Legends phrases, which I personally rarely use. 4) Interesting events and updates in general - The developers did not abandon the game from the very release, which also maintains a stable online. 5) Russian voice acting - I'm a big fan of Russian localization in games, here it is done well, noooooo .... It's just not bad. It does not carry a special semantic load, as in Sij, so sometimes you just do not pay attention to what the characters say, but pay attention to how they say. The English version has accents that we simply cannot repeat, but for the very fact that it is a huge respecter! In addition to localization, I generally want to praise the presence of the native phrases of Legends that do not need translation, like my favorite Octane: "- Look, they crawl in the distance, like little cucarachas" 6) Team interaction - the game is not made for solo players, it was originally designed for well-coordinated teamwork, and this is done boldly, you just need to click on the item you need or found with the mouse wheel, as the character will say that he needs it or he found this, so even if you play with a voice, that's all however, this function remains useful, because you can mark that you will take it. Of the minuses, I can only note one thing: 1) The pricing policy of EA gumes - To get a very beautiful skin, you must either grind like crazy (and even then not everything can be obtained like that), or you have to pay a very handsome sum for this, I remember the times when for a complete collection of cases (out of 24, only 2 were given out for free) and the relic needed to unfasten about 7000 stable ones. I have never liked EA for their prices, which even Americans cannot afford, let alone us. (Still shivering from the price of all the Sims add-ons) What's the bottom line? We have a great battle royale with constantly evolving content and interesting setting, good replayability. The game is free, so if you are a fan of battle battles, be sure to try it out! "}

{"text" : "Plot with good primitive, but wasted potential. The game tells the story of Alex Mercer, a man who allegedly underwent "experiments" involving a virus that was spread in the city. With his mutations, he can shape his body in different ways and consume other people by taking in his appearance and memories. All of these factors do add to the gameplay and it is one of the greatest symbols of the game. First of all it's really fun, you can do everything, climb buildings, destroy things, catch and shoot people, and with the upgrade system it gets even better, you can improve your disguise, get claws, giant hands, armor, etc. What made me happy, is that the game has decent levels of difficulty given the character and all the things you can do, challenges were presented. However, the game's artificial intelligence is horrible. The city is well modeled, but nothing plausible, there are only buildings to be climbed and there is nowhere you can actually interact (apart from military bases). After a while, the game gets sickening, missions too repetitive, and the story leaves much to be desired. Remarkable lapse of personalities, bad characters without exploration and that add nothing to the plot combined with very superficial dialogues that leave the plot boring and tiring. From one point, I continued to play just to get it to zero soon. As expected, the end of the game comes down to a more or less cutscene, and does not close with anything grand or even fair with the game. Prototype is certainly a work that divides opinions, but I say that, despite its many problems, the game brings great gameplay, excellent CGIs and somewhere, we have a fun and stress-free game. I recommend it, but if I had to rate it, I would give it a 6/10. "}

{"text" : "is an educational game aimed at perfecting the conjugation and grammar of our dear darlings (or even adults in difficulty, or wishing to learn our language). It is also the first title in a trilogy from a small Provencal studio. The interest is twofold, since in addition to perfecting knowledge, it allows you to follow a beautiful story of Heroic-Fantasy in the background. We have no impact on this, it just progresses as we respond. We play a little the role of the writer by completing the empty sentences: several word proposals are displayed and we must choose the correct answer to move forward. An error displays a red frame giving advice and chord rules. Three wrong answers and you have to start the level all over again. Divided into 20 levels of slightly increasing difficulty, the game is intended to be fairly short, but may last for children. No response time is imposed, they can take time to think. Short courses are also available at the end of each level in order to summarize what has been seen during this one. As well as a lexicon, accessible from the menu, which gives the definition of the terms used during the adventure. The game focuses on subject-verb chords and the present indicative. There are therefore some time differences there so as not to increase the difficulty. It's a shame for seasoned readers, but not being targeted here, it's less embarrassing. The target audience would rather be made up of children around 7-8 years old, level CE1 - CE2. "}

I think there should have been only one finale and the room should have ended like this; During this adventure, we get very hot on Del, we see a ray of hope, a new life in him that will make us forget what we have experienced in the past. We want to meet him at the end of the summer and explain our feelings. We tell him to wait for us and rush towards the helicopter, but when we get there, neither the helicopter nor Del are around. We climb up to Del's hut slowly and see that nobody is there. We put on the headset on the table and hear Del's voice, we ask him why he is not waiting for us, he says he cannot stay in this place any longer and wants to leave as soon as possible. There are a few tears dripping down onto the table. Del hopes we understand him. After a short dialogue between them, the helicopter arrives. Del wishes us good luck and wants us to go to the helicopter. Hanry slowly releases the headset and moves towards the window, the helicopter looking straight. The rescue team says there is nobody coming and asks for take-off as soon as possible (the fire is getting bigger and the smoke is no longer visible.) The helicopter takes off and starts to rise, and at that time, the headset on the table says, "Hanry, are you there Hanry? Hnary!" their voices are heard. Hanry sees herself in the reflection of the window ... At that moment the screen goes dark. Of course, we can open more what I wrote above, we can complete the dialogue between them. The final idea I want to explain here; Hanry did not want to go back to the past, but the future rejected him. Other than that, the dialogues and acting in the game were superb. "}

The game is to properly remove the gray blocks so that the blue block is on a platform of the same color. It sounds simple, but the game often isn't. It happens that to pass a given level we have to repeat the sequence several times, because there is no room for mistakes here. Speaking of bugs, I didn't find any. What can be changed / added?

The orders are quite different, but duplication cannot be avoided! The customer orders are simple repairs or, for example, the replacement of defective parts. After a successful order, customers can leave a rating, 5 stars if they are satisfied, one if they are not. The reviews of their own workshop can be read on a website called "Bongle". In this way, you rise in the level over time and unlock new parts, tools and / or work tables. Unfortunately, the career mode becomes quite monotonous after a few hours, but unfortunately that does not stay away. In this mode you can build whatever you want. There are no limits! Put together your dream PC or design the ugliest PC in the world - everything is possible and offers almost endless fun! The graphics are completely sufficient, the components in particular are shown quite detailed and realistically. This is due, among other things, to the fact that PC Building Simulator has licenses from various famous PC parts manufacturers, such as Nvidia, AMD, Corsair. Small improvements, such as anti-aliasing, could still be made. Once the PC has been built, it doesn't stop there! The PC can be tested and overclocked with various software programs such as 3DMark or OCCT - a great feature! This even requires a certain knowledge in this area, the assembly itself, however, is kept fairly simple and easy, in some places maybe too easy. There is currently a DLC that contains 2 exclusive special edition versions of the NZXT H700 and H500 cases. It should be noted that the DLC so far only contains these two skins.

{"text" : "During photography class with her teacher Mark Jefferson (Derek Phillips), Max experiences a vision of a lighthouse being destroyed by a swelling tornado. Leaving for the restroom to regain her composure, she witnesses classmate Nathan Prescott (Nik Shriner) murder a girl. In a single, sudden effort, she develops the ability to rewind time and rescues the girl. Max finds she saved her childhood friend Chloe Price (Ashly Burch). The two reunite and go for a walk at the lighthouse from Max's nightmare, where Max reveals to Chloe her capacity to travel back in time. It is established the vision is rather the reckoning of a future event: a storm approaching the town. The following day, Max observes fellow student Kate Marsh (Dayeanne Hutton) being subjected to bullying for a viral video depicting her kissing several students at a party. It is implied that she was drugged, and Max suspects Nathan as the perpetrator. Meeting Chloe at the diner where her mother Joyce (Cissy Jones) works, they decide to experiment with Max's power at Chloe's secret scrapyard hideout. However, strain causes Max to have a nosebleed and faint. Chloe takes her back to Blackwell, but class is halted when everyone is called out to the courtyard. Seeing Kate commit suicide by jumping off the roof of the girls' dorm, Max manages to rewind as time stops unexpectedly. Reaching Kate, Max has the opportunity to convince her to get down from the roof. Max ultimately vows to uncover what happened to Kate and Chloe's missing friend Rachel Amber. Breaking into the principal's office that night to investigate, Max and Chloe search through his files and enter the pool for a swim before evading campus security and fleeing back to Chloe's place. The next morning, they sneak into the motorhome of Frank Bowers (Daniel Bonjour), a drug dealer and Rachel's friend. They learn that Rachel was in a romantic relationship with Frank and lied to Chloe about it, causing Chloe to storm off feeling betrayed. Back at her dormitory, Max examines a childhood photo of her and Chloe, but is suddenly transported to the day that picture was taken. Max prevents Chloe's father William (Joe Ochman) from dying in a traffic collision, which inadvertently creates an alternative reality where William is alive but Chloe has been paralysed from the neck down as a result of a collision in her own car. Max uses the photo that let her save William to undo her decision and return to the present day, restoring Chloe's health. Continuing their investigation, Max and Chloe obtain clues leading them to an abandoned barn owned by the influential Prescott family. They discover a hidden bunker that contains pictures of Kate and Rachel tied up and intoxicated, with Rachel shown being buried at Chloe's secret hideout. They hurry back to the scrapyard and find Rachel dead, much to Chloe's despair. Max follows Chloe at the school party to confront Nathan, believing he will target fellow student Victoria Chase (Dani Knights). They receive a text from Nathan threatening to destroy the evidence, returning them to the scrapyard. Suddenly, the two are ambushed by Jefferson, who anaesthetises Max and kills Chloe. Max is kidnapped and held captive in the "Dark Room", a place Jefferson has been drugging and photographing young girls to capture their innocence. Max escapes into a photograph and emerges back at the beginning in Jefferson's class. She alerts Chloe's stepfather David Madsen (Don McManus), the head of security at Blackwell, getting Jefferson arrested. Max is given the opportunity to go to San Francisco and have one of her photos displayed in an art gallery. She calls Chloe from the event, realising that, for all her effort, the storm has reached Arcadia Bay. Max teleports to the time she took the gallery photo, which eventually leads her to sojourn alternative realities as they devolve into a dreamscape nightmare. By the story's end, Max arrives at the lighthouse with Chloe. They confront the fact that Max brought the approaching superstorm into existence by availing herself of the time travel abilities in the first place, and the only way to prevent it is for her to go back in time once more and allow Chloe to be killed by Nathan. Max must make a choice: sacrifice Chloe's life to save Arcadia Bay, or sacrifice Arcadia Bay in order to spare Chloe. "}
{"text" : "The Complex is a new FMV “game“ in the likes of Late Shift, that puts us in the position of a young scientist trapped in a lab fighting a new virus and finding out if there is something more to it all.  You are Amy Tenant a scientist researching on dangerous nanocells in a modern lab facility and find yourself locked in the lab with dangerous intruders and the even more dangerous nanocells with hints of spies, terrorists, an old romance and betrayal in the air. I personally liked the story and found it to be very entertaining. The actors were doing a good job and were in no way campy like in the older FMV games. The settings seemed realistic to me. There is an office like setting, outdoor setting and of course the lab complex. I can really judge the lab as I am not a professional scientist, but to me it looked good and did not break the immersion or looked obviously like a movie set. Even though it is an all-around good game, I somehow did not manage to get emotionally involved as I did in games like “The Last of us”. Maybe it was due to the playtime being extremely short (I played around 2.5 hours and I did idle a bit)?  A really good movie like game. I don’t know how to rate this. It was good Honestly, there is not a lot gameplay. It is really a movie where at various points in the game (around 10 or less) you have to make important or not so important decision that may change the ending, not the course of the game, mind you. Music: None whatsoever. Only normal sound and the voice of the voice actors If you can enjoy a game that is like a movie with not much gameplay going on, for a price of around 12 USD, but a well told story and a playtime of around 2 hours for one playthrough, then this is for you.

{"text" : "1. The official Chinese is back. This is a great job. It is no longer the so-called bad money of wegame. The reason why I don’t have much time to play in 2019 is that I don’t have Chinese, not because I don’t understand, but because I don’t have a strong sense of substitution. 2. Since the TS GT300 was sold, F1 and Dust Rally have been played with the handle, and it was immediately enjoyable to get started. The XBOX handle supports trigger vibration. This feature was initially only available in Microsoft forza horizon. 3. The schedule in the game is still the original schedule, and the tracks in Vietnam and the Netherlands have also been retained (the first time in history that game players have access to the track earlier than real drivers), I don’t know if this year’s real schedule will be updated later . 4. The racing car painting is still the original version. Those who want to see Black Arrow (no one would like to see it) probably have to wait. 5. AI should be the weakest in the past. I usually like to assist in all levels, and I can challenge 105 AI (the previous generation can only outperform 90 AI at most). 6. Compared with the previous generation, the car has stronger grip and more sensitive brakes. In short, it is better to drive. Especially the rain station, which is a hundred times better than the previous generation, basically no different from dry land. 7. The performance of the car is almost the same as in 19 years, and the nest method is still the second. It is estimated that the next version will be weakened. 8. This generation of drs and oil volume control is fully automatic, drs will be turned on automatically as long as it meets the conditions, without manual operation. The same is true for the amount of fuel. When you enter the pursuit state, it will automatically switch to rich fuel mode. It feels like this game is becoming more and more foolish. In summary, IGN can give a high score of 9 points. I think it makes sense. In terms of hands-on experience, the feel will be much better than 2019. Especially when playing with the handle, the gap between the factory details, I hope the next generation of dust Rally quality has also been strengthened. "}

X finally joined the man-machine 1Vs1 mode that was not available in the previous game (finally able to pick the opponent). Each character in this game has 3 types, and there are changes in the moves. Only the appearance changes. Advantages: 1.

{"text" : "Normally, RPG Maker games, I tend to shy away from them. And I admit I wouldn't have had this game in a bundle, I might never have played it. Very badly would have taken me. Always Sometimes Monsters is a bit of a 'real life simulator' in which you play as a pickup writer and whose goal will be to try to win back her ex while he or she is getting ready. to get married. Put it like that, I admit, it doesn't sound crazy ... Except that in Always Sometimes Monsters, you are made to understand that, like in real life, you live in a world of mеrdе. Can't pay the rent to the raw landlord? You end up on the street. Do you play a character who is not white skinned and Caucasian? Some characters do not hesitate to throw racist remarks in your face. Do you play a gay or a lesbian? Some people openly call you a tapеttе or a gouinе. Like in real life, what. But the choices to be made in this game would be much too easy if you were the only one able to take on the role of the victim ... Because after all, since you are financially strapped, why not rip off this party girl who wants that you buy her drugs by giving her cheap pills instead of the fancy stuff she wanted ... Or maybe that poor granny who invites you to clean her house and whose apartment is filled with valuable stuff. After all, don't you notice one or two less trinkets? And if you're too honest for that, at worst, you can always get hired as a temp in the city's slaughterhouse. Well, we'll just have to put pigs still alive in a blender to make sausages, but at least the pay will be substantial. And while we're at it: you want to win back your ex ... But after all, nothing prevents you from accepting a little threesome from time to time ... And why not a little threesome while here we are ? It's good for morale, it seems. And if you are too prudish for that, at worst, you can always go to the VIP area of ​​a strip club to enjoy a little private dance ... You will understand, Always Sometimes Monster n ' is not a nice, silly or even easy game. The slightest wrong answer can lead to a direct game over (fortunately it's quite rare, but you can have one from the very first dialogue) or worse: to consequences impossible to correct for several days plus ♥♥♥♥. It is of course possible to save scumming, but when you realize that a choice made at the very beginning of the game ends up seriously handicapping you at the very end, going back is quite complicated ... In short, if this recommendation does not scare you, if you speak English (the game is only available in this bank) and if you have nothing against RPG Maker games, give it a try. From a narrative as well as a playful point of view, there is little chance that it will leave you indifferent, for good or for bad. And if the price turns you off, know that € 10 is fairly fair considering that the story ends in 10-15 hours but that, due to the mass of choices offered and possible endings, the game offers a fairly substantial replayability without for all that to repeat itself too much. And if you really are a jerk, know that the game is regularly on sale (as at the time of this writing). After that, it's up to you, but personally, I don't regret the experience. "}

Personally I would have added new missions for Bj over time, now, when the game is over, Eva's Hammer is incredibly desolate and replaying the same missions is particularly easy since I have unlocked almost all of Bj's talents. Despite all the game allows you both direct and tactical attack tactics. I hope they do another one. "}
{"text" : "This game was recommended to me by a good friend. At first I was skeptical because it was not one of those typical well-known / big games that everyone else plays and whose 3D graphics look so real ... After a short time, however, I realized what a mistake it was while playing, so hastily to draw conclusions from awareness and price. This game managed to convince me with his (which should be the main reason for the purchase), the loving characters and his. Not to forget the one that is always appropriate and that can touch every heart. At the same time united are - even a little humor! After all the pieces of the puzzle had come together for me and you finally reached the end, you just wish to continue playing ... After several years of gaming I am so moved by a story for the first time. It's so hard to write this review without spoiling, so I give you a tip: 10/10 !!! "}

{"text" : "After having passed the first part, I decided to buy the second, mostly because I had a lot of fun and despite being a role-playing game, I don't particularly like it, it seemed like a great game. This second part, the truth is that at the beginning it left me a little cold, since the fighting system is not as linear as in the first part, but in the end you get used to it and the truth is that it gives a lot of life. About the story, it seems to me the best of the game, the truth is that they have given it many variations and they have worked out a very good story, also, that this time the game is doubled, it helps a lot to hook you. The only negative point that I would put it, is that perhaps it is something short ... but I'm not sure if this is something negative, since it has been shorter than the first part, but looking at the hours on Steam it turns out that I have played to this almost double .. so with that I say it all, very entertaining and fun! In addition, it is not difficult to find a good price in the sales. "}

In search of immortality, they turned to the gods for help, who presented them with truly eternal artificial bodies - however, having absorbed their souls and made them their faithful slaves. For sixty million years, the Necrons - former Necrontirs - have slept in the deep crypts of desert planets. Their masters waited until the galaxy again overflowed with intelligent beings: the gods needed souls, billions of souls. And in the 41st millennium, such a time has come, the necrons awakened and began the ruthless extermination of all intelligent beings they met indiscriminately. Their unexpected blow further crippled the already decaying Human Empire. "}

Let me start with the modifications - there are a lot of them. It doesn't matter if it's tracks, cars, cameras to record your laps, texture ♥♥♥♥♥. Great mod support, which is huge. But since Assetto is a simulator, not all mods are good. There are cars that lack realism. And here I will mention the DLC. They are made great, as you probably all guessed. And yes, it pays off to buy them. But on promotion. I just don't like the fact that in the menu for choosing what to race, cars that are not in the stand are marked as available in the DLC. I don't like it because it looks like "HEY, SEE WHAT GREAT FURY ARE AVAILABLE IN EXPANSIONS !!! 11 !!" You know what I'm talking about. Intuitive sidebar menu. Options - more than you think.

These are an open world (the big city replaces the closed island from the first part), more characters known from comic books, new ways to eliminate enemies as well as new gadgets, new gliding mechanics and more interesting and more challenging Riddler puzzles. In addition to Batman, we will have the opportunity to play Catwoman and Robin (Harley Quinn's Revenge). These will be short but pleasant sequences that will allow us to do the destruction in a different style. The theme song is brilliant, making it more enjoyable to see concept art or character trophies on the menu. It is worth mentioning the side missions that expand and extend the already short game. They are an interesting variety to the game and remain no less interesting than the main plot. I recommend the game and so is the Joker :) "}

Systematically, the side-scrolling turn-based RPG story is well-developed, and you can feel as if you are reading a picture book with watercolor-like graphics. I didn't feel that the operability and difficulty level were difficult, and I was able to proceed smoothly without raising the level, so it was very good that I could play with an emphasis on the story.

{"text" : "The more I play this game the more I fall in love with it... Starting from humble beginnings as a driver taking freelance jobs you will eventually earn enough money to buy your own truck, then the fun really begins(apart from having to pay for your own petrol). Jobs are scattered across the whole of Europe with a variety of XP rewards on offer based on the cargo you will be towing...hook up the trailer, then just drive. As with most simulator games this could be seen as only appealing to a niche section of gamers but Eurotruck 2 really is different, I had no interest in trucks before this game but I was still drawn to it and it has quickly become one of my favourite games. It is essentially a driving simulator but there is a bit of added depth with the ability to build garages and hire other drivers to work for you but for the most part you will be flying down a motorway, watching your speed, watching the traffic, checking that ever so slightly tight bend(cos u will roll if not careful).. Having played many types of games the question of immersion often comes up...not long after first buying this game I was playing one night...Headphones on..Driving down the motorway..Listening to the in game radio(a metal channel) then it began to rain...wipers on ..slow down a bit i'm starting to weave around.. that short time driving down that motorway was the most immersed I've ever been in any game. Special mention should also be given to the Devs..they are constantly releasing updates..listening to player feedback..offering cheap dlc (paint jobs) and periodically releasing larger dlc that opens up new roads and countries and they continue to do this despite working on American Truck Simulator. They also offer the world of trucks website which you can upload your trucking profile to in game and earn achievements and rewards through there ...for christmas they had a challenge to deliver presents over a distance equal to the distance between their offices and the north pole..reward?.. free Dlc.. So in summary, Great game..don't be put off by the 'Sim' aspect and support the Devs because they really deserve it and already have one confirmed sale of American Truck Simulator. "}

{"text" : "The game begins quite intriguingly. The main character collides with a man in a hood, and after a short fight, dies. He becomes a ghost. But such an unusual prologue is not followed by anything particularly outstanding - an ordinary detective story in which you don't need to use any logic of your own to calculate the criminal. they are certainly not perfect, maybe some of them are a little boring or poorly revealed. As for the main character - Ronan. Personally, I liked him, his story made me empathize throughout the game. I can also say about the antagonist - Zvonar. His image was intriguing and bewitching. it is monotonous. All you need is to search locations in search of evidence and documents and solve elementary puzzles. But, in the game, so to speak, there are also stealth elements. These are demons that can only be approached and neutralized from the back, but it's not difficult at all. I can't say anything bad about her, I personally liked everything. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a very good idea, but not very well developed. But despite this, it is worth playing, at least for the sake of achievements (it is quite possible to knock everything out in one playthrough). But this game dragged me in and was remembered by its history, despite its shortcomings. 8/10 "}

L4D is a great game to play with friends and meet new people (multiplayer), but it is also possible to play alone (singleplayer) in the different game modes. I've played it for several hours on Xbox 360 before I even got it here on Steam. The game also has a story mode, with different game scenarios where you follow the saga of 4 survivors trying to escape the chaos generated by the zombie horde. There is the possibility to add content created by players in the Steam Workshop as textures for weapons, characters, soundtrack and even new scenarios. It's a classic of its kind and is ideal for those who like the FPS + zombie / zombie apocalypse mix. If you haven't played yet, give it a try and try to play with friends, the fun is guaranteed :) "}

{"text" : "I wonder why this game has such mixed reviews. Avoiding the stupidity of my opponents and minor bugs that prevent me from completing the location, I didn't notice anything that would force me to write a negative review. You have to support ours. As for artificial intelligence, you can see that it is highly artificial - soldiers who do not notice that their friend falls in front of his eyes from a weapon with a silencer, soldiers hiding behind a curtain in front of a sniper so that you can see their entire body and most importantly the entire head or soldiers blocking in the surrounding elements . All this helps us, but the game then becomes too simple. The campaign will last up to 10 hours, we have the Warsaw Uprising here, intertwined with the memories of the main character. The game is graphically nice, and there is nothing to complain about the special effects. Polish dubbing is also an advantage. The mission is also varied, rolling buildings, mountains, mission at night. There is probably no game with such a theme, so it's worth checking and trying. "}

By purchasing this add-on and launching the game from the very beginning, the game was instantly transformed. This oppressive and viscous atmosphere arose again. I believe that those who play this game for the first time and are not familiar with the original should play with this DLC! Nothing in the remake sound will provide you with such mystery to explore and relief when entering the saveroom.

I think that these sounds with music were originally supposed to be in the game. Not by default, of course, but also optional. "}

{"text" : "Edit: The game has been released on Zhihu column evaluation, click here: ================================== ==================== Amazing-this is my first impression of Shadow. The Japanese dubbing, Japanese music, and 2.5D scroll painting style shocked me. I hope I can continue to like this game. However, things backfired. After 10 minutes of shallow play, some problems followed-operation. After getting used to the perspective of XCOM and many other similar games, "holding down the Alt key to rotate the screen" is driving me crazy. Don't underestimate this inconspicuous setting. I don't want and don't like to adapt to his operation for a game. The WASD key to move the camera is not the default, but it can be modified-difficult to manipulate. This problem was not obvious when I was controlling Hayato alone, but after Mugen joined, I think the operation has become complicated. Although it is possible to assign commands to players and start at the same time in Shadow Mode, each person can only receive one simple command! For example, if I want Hayato to open the door and attack with a shuriken, this can't be done. It is impossible for Takuma to attack two people one after another. I don't know if this is the game deliberately or how, but this really reduces the game's playability and strategic activities. In fact, rather than "strategy games" or "stealth games", I think Shadow is more of an action/reaction game. It is true that strategy is very important, but some accidents still require players to react quickly. -Cannot pause. Is this a problem? Maybe. Since I don't arrange actions in advance, at least give me a pause in analyzing the situation. Sorry, there is no such operation! The direct result of this is that after each small level (a small confined area) starts, you either succeed or fail. There is no one-shot failure and then pause to give you a chance to deal with it. If you get out of the Yaomozi, go directly to F9! Although uncomfortable, I think the level design of the game cleverly avoids this problem, because the enemies between the small level and the small level are relatively independent. After you clear an area, you have unlimited time to observe the next level. The enemy, arrange tactics. So the chance to breathe was made by myself, even though I was upset, I recognized it! -Achievement party play carefully! It took me an hour and a half for F5/F9 to get used to the game with countless points, but I got the 1/9 small achievement in the final review! No major achievements! Many achievements seem to be demanding, and it is very likely that you will not get all of the ten rounds. Unfortunately, I just made the party. . . The big 1/9 has become my nightmare. . . -No automatic saving. Although the developer has humanely added the "Last Saved" timer at the top of the game interface, many times I was so excited that I didn't press F5, and I felt even more regretful when I saw that a few minutes of magical tricks were destroyed. I think automatic saving is necessary, but depending on the saving speed of the game, I am afraid that the engine needs to be further optimized to achieve. It is worth mentioning that the game loading level is super slow, and the SSD is useless. Although it does not affect the overall experience of the game, it is quite uncomfortable. Since Mimimi is still a small workshop, it is easy to make a fortune from the shadows. I still hope the developers can cheer. -It's hard? It's probably because of over-learning. . . -After the end of mission 1, Takuma: (self-brained in Battlefield 4 dubbing) ♫Fuck, you are paralyzed and beat allies! Who from MB hit me? ! TMD almost exploded to Lao Tzu! ♫ ================================================ ===================== But. . . In addition to the disadvantages, the rest are all advantages! I have never played Allied Death Squad, but the shadows are really attractive! Japanese dubbing is great! Small advertisement: I will play for a while tomorrow, I will write a more specific evaluation in the Zhihu column (the address is in my personal file), I hope everyone will support it~~ Hey praise "}

{"text" : "This is one of those classical hidden-object adventure game that offers you a huge twist among the gameplay. It serves to be different from the other hidden-object games out on the market. I rarely play hidden-object games but this one gave me tons of fun as for being a great quality point and click game. Ⓞ Take on the role of Alex Hunter and investigate the mysterious disappearance of Professor Patterson. Follow the trail of clues and find out who has captured Professor Patterson.  Gameplay wises you to drag and drop different items. Combine and manipulate various found objects to find a solution for the arisen problems and puzzles. There is a variety of puzzles and hidden object parts so the game keeps moving at a nice pace like a book, it's a good page turner. Some of the more puzzling aspects of this game is simply trying to figure out how to do something, or just where an item is. The puzzles are very enjoyable and there is a auto save so you don't have to worry about loosing much progress if something would happened.  Ⓞ Casual mode offers you a tutorial which is really helpful. You have a journal to note down stuff and a compass which opens the map. During your investigation, you will unlock new locations which you can travel in between with. There are hints if you get stuck and a guide for your own personal service.  Ⓞ - Reasonable price for the content - Steam Trading Cards - Bonus Chapter that follows the path from the main story - Amazing quality for a game that was released 2013 - Well designed - Certain details are superb  - Extras such as: Wallpapers, great Music/Soundtracks and lovely Sketches - In-game Achievements and awards  - Expert mode Ⓞ This will give you information about the Pentah crime syndicate and all the syndicate leaders that work for this corporation. You can also find plot twists that connects to the main story aswell as a background story of each main character in the game.  Ⓞ  Your task is to save this man by completing tons of different and unique puzzles. Find and destroy the machine dubbed Lord of the Mind and become a hero. The game has a thrilling story that will lead you through different places like: sewers, a mental hospital, garages, houses, boats, islands and into a bizarre alternative world. It certainly has that steampunk theme going on, which I enjoy a lot.  Ⓞ - Voice acting is meh - Story doesn't really catches your interest very much even though it's sweet and grim - Some of the mini riddles are a bit too ambivalent I wish there was a sequel to this game. With hours of captivating game time, a richly detailed world, and a storyline inspired by classic detective novels,   is a game I can recommend for the HOG fans and even the casual gamers because of its different and unique aspects.

In addition, one must observe the entire psychological side related to the many choices available, which lead to the 16 different endings of the game. On the technical side, the game uses Valve's Source engine, which makes the game graphically beautiful compared to other Indie games. The soundtrack is original and adapts perfectly to the game and there are subtitles in PT-BR made by the producer itself that for some reason are not on Steam, but that can be downloaded on the internet and placed in the game folder.

{"text" : "In general, an unremarkable corridor shooter with horror and role-playing elements. There is no plot, as such, and was not foreseen - a spaceship, where a deadly virus leaked, after which the entire staff turned into nasty monsters - zombies. I liked the fact that the game adheres to the classic concept in the sense that it would be logical to assume - since the action takes place in space, then there should be blasters with which you can solve all the enemies. Yes, there are futuristic weapons. Personally, I hate futurism in games, since everything that is present here is fully compensated by the classic concept and the face of the traditional weapons of all horror zombies - a shotgun and a chainsaw. Of course, the arsenal is modest, the protagonist is not some kind of athlete who will run tremendously, jump and knead everyone, but this does not prevent you from enjoying the game. Pros: 1) Carnage: in this game, strikes with hordes of zombies are not uncommon. 2) Gloomy surroundings. 3) Quite acceptable graphics. 4) Skillful alternation of futurism and classics is a huge plus. 5) Ambients do their job. Although the sound palette does not shine with originality, it fills the atmosphere with horror. 6) Bonuses and additional modes. Any self-respecting game should have bonuses. This tradition has been observed by many since the distant 90s. 7) Interesting fauna. The good news is that you can plunge into the horde of enemies and kill them. Maybe there is no variety of enemies, but they seemed interesting to me. Nevertheless, despite the fact that some enemies have an analogy with bad comrades from similar projects, there is a certain zest. P.s. However, if you come close and fire a shotgun, it doesn't matter what their abilities are :) 8) Survival and role-playing elements. It's nice to see that the developers have brought in some variety. 9) Adequate pricing policy Of the minuses, I note that: 1) Low duration of the game. 2) Lack of plot. 3) Too many aspects of the gameplay have migrated straight from Dead Space (Hi Isaac). 4) Considering the previous subparagraph, I will say that once, the games caused me boredom for a while - the monotonous corridor carnage got a little tired. 5) Predictability. 6) Mediocre interface. Summing up, I will say that despite all the minuses that are in the game, nothing prevented me from hanging in it for the whole day. I went through the entire campaign, mastered the additional modes and shot from the bottom of my heart. This is quite a decent job for a budget project, which is definitely worth paying attention to, and even more so for zombie-themed supporters. I liked the game. I hope you enjoy it too. Have a nice game. "}
{"text" : "So this time we have a Carpack only. Sad that there is again no Oval delivered, which would be cool to have, specially in this DLC because of the Dallara Indy Car and also the Ford Fusion, which are made for oval racing. But ok, it is as it is. So let´s move on then to the Cars. Bam! What a Car. Overall Look & Feel is great. Loved it from the first Minute on. Cockpit looks awesome. Sound is great. Could be more agressive sounding though. The FFB of the  C7.R is one of the best in Game, in my Opinion. The handling is phenomenal. Whenever i drive a GT3 Race in the Future and it comes to choosing the Car, i will consider the Corvette first. For me it´s 'the' Car of the DLC. Look and Feel 9/10 Sound 8/10 Handling 9/10 FFB 10/10 21 Paintjobs (some only change Numbers and smaller Decals) 6/10 This Car was a big Surprise to me. As i said the Corvette was the reason to buy this DLC and the Cadi was more or less a nice to have to enlargen the Carpark but after a few Rounds on the Nordschleife i loved it. Great Look and Feel, great Sound. The Cockpit-Display is not my taste but it´s functionality and overview is worth to look at all those bright Rainbow Colours. FFB-wise the Cadi is nearly as good as the Corvette and offers a great Handling and feel of weight and breakpoints. Look and Feel 7/10 Sound 7/10 Handling 8/10 FFB 9/10 21 Paintjobs 8/10 This is the weak Point of the DLC. Look and feel is ok, Cockpit looks ok. Sound is mediocre and the worst is the FFB and the handling. So maybe judging the Car by driving the Nordschleife instead of an oval Track is not very suitable but because of the lack of Ovals it is best to drive it on a track that offers a wide Variety of different Curves etc. All in all the Car felt slippy without proper Control and to lightweighted. Other than the C7.R and the Cadi which both had a good feel of Weight. Sometimes it seems to drive on Ice. Also the only 4 Gears are feeling strange. I will (have to) give it a new try when some Ovals have arrived. Look and Feel 5/10 Sound 5/10 Handling 4/10 FFB 3/10 40 Paintjobs  10/10 Great Look and Feel, great Sound and a good Enhancement to the Formula Cars in the Game. Unfortunately the same as for the Fusion goes for the Dallara. It would be best to drive that Car on a proper Oval Track. That´s what it is made for. So the Nordschleife isn´t necessary the place to be for Indy Cars but however, i pushed it over the NS and it is Fun to drive. Handling and FFB felt good to me. Not outstanding but for sure one of the Cars with the more better handling in PCars. As well as for the Fusion i will give the Car a new try when some Ovals take place in the Game. For now i say... Look and Feel 8/10 Sound 9/10 Handling 8/10 FFB 8/10 21 Paintjobs 8/10 So we have a bit of a mixed Pack. 2 great Cars with the C7.R and the Cadi, 1 in my opinion more of the not so good Cars with the Ford Fusion (Ovals pls) and a good Indy Car with the Dallara (again pls Ovals). As i said it´s not very just to judge the Pack without the proper Tracks for 2 of the Cars but for whats there today i give: (evtly being edited when driven on Ovals) All in all worth it. "}

{"text" : "I’m not here to debate what is and isn’t a game, especially when the creator themselves describes their creation as more of a toy. What I’m here to do is tell you why it’s good, or perhaps why I spent seven hours of my weekend playing it. It’s true that Townscaper lacks the goals or action of what you’ll usually find on Steam. But what it offers instead is an incredible amount of creative control to build adorable towns as familiar or fantastical as your heart desires. This does something that no SimCity or builder has ever done, really, which is simplify the creative process down to single clicks of the mouse, and produce wonders of incredible scope and scale from them. Townscaper is a town-building toy, I believe we’ve established that already. When you load into the game, you’re greeted with a vast expanse of water. Clicking anywhere will produce a tiny piece of paved ground. Clicking the ground again will construct a tiny house atop it, in the selected color on the left. You can expand the ground a significant distance by clicking around the water, and make buildings pretty much as large and tall as you like. That’s it, that’s all you do. With this simple interface, you’re free to build islands and towers and castles to your heart’s content, just by stacking building pieces atop each other with but a click. Now, the reason this works so well is because of how the game puts the buildings together. You’re not mashing blocks together into weird shapes, after all. No matter what you do in Townscape, it’s going to look good because the system dynamically adjusts your structures by what you place. So, a single click makes a tiny house. A click on its roof makes it a two-story house. Clicking next to it makes it longer. You can turn your buildings into arches, give them steepled roofs, build elevated walkways atop them, suspend them in the air with pillars, and so much more. Certain combinations of elevations can produce steps, and boxing in a section of ground with houses creates gardens. There’s so much to do here that you can spend hours just exploring the possibilities, without even cracking into your magnum opus. This is the beauty of Townscaper, the fact that you can’t go wrong. Everything fits together, and everything is designed to look good while doing it. And if you don’t like how something comes out, you can unmake it just as easily with right-click. The game is full of wonderful dynamic details like postboxes, shrubberies, clotheslines, and birds. Literally everything you do is going to be amazing, and I know that for a fact because I turned my children loose on it and they made amazing islands and towers with no coaching whatsoever. This is an unparalleled tool for creation, allowing people with any degree of skill or coordination to make towns they’ve only dreamed of, and to have fun doing it. I never realized how specifically I needed this in my library, and now that I have it, I honestly can’t stop tinkering. Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them at   or on my  ! "}

All the main important-key moments in the MKH storyline capture many, the game is not dedicated to one hero, but the war of factions and worlds among themselves, the factions are divided into "Lin Kuei, Black Dragon, White Lotous, Brotherhood of shadows, Special Forces" each of the factions has own leaders, and their goals The entire main plot of the Mortal Kombat Series is a war, a war between factions on the ground, a war of several factions with one Demigod, in the storyline, we play for terrestrial factions advancing against other worlds, while in the network mode - you can choose a faction for which you will carry the cross Due to the abundance of events covering many heroes - the plot may seem multifaceted, but all good stories about wars of such a scale should look like this, especially in the fantasy world. The ninth part of Mortal Kombat began restarting the series, so in some places I will compare them The game has a storyline - and separate modes, both on the network - and alone The very modes (Try your luck, various towers, trials, there is even a training mode) give the freedom to choose the game for a character, each character has its own distinctive abilities, and three styles for each, with different buns - features, special combos and specials, techniques. Everyone chooses their favorite, but in my opinion there are no bad characters, you need to learn how to play for everyone, and there are no "unfit" or "imbalances" there, it all depends on your skill and desire. In the ninth part, there are fewer choices, and MK9 itself is worse, in MKH the animation of movements is better made, there are more various combos and special moves, as well as in the previous one there are costumes, and additional guest characters from the DLC, for a fee, they are guest due to the fact that they were added to the game for a change, and only for one part, most are not at all in the lore. At the request of the community - or at the request of the developers. The modes are very diverse, there is a classic battle (both with friends on the network and alone), where you simply choose whom to fight for, and if alone, then with whom (the AI ​​will control the character), there are no modifications or what something unusual, but there is "try your luck", where you can also choose a character, but there are modifiers in battle that give an advantage or, on the contrary, complicate, they fall randomly on both sides, each one gets a different number and various modifications, as well there are towers where you alternately kill opponents - reaching the boss, killing him - the tower will be considered passed, there are also various towers Lack of optimization, in general, that is, even on powerful computers there is a chance that the game will lag, here FPS is a game of roulette , how will anyone be lucky regardless of hardware Game port from consoles - and an extremely bad port In the game, a small online game is dead A large abundance of DLS on additional characters The need for a super-high-speed Internet connection for a normal game on the network If your opponent has a small FPS and a bad Internet, he will lag and your game has become more varied, prettier, more convenient, and less twitchy-eyed The characters now have styles - more special techniques The girls' suits no longer look like bikinis, they still have open parts, but now they look more like warriors - fighting girls than model girls on the beach New, well-developed characters, which are interesting to play The plot has become much more interesting than in MK9 Animation and colors are more natural, and the very game mechanics became more realistic "}

{"text" : "So how can I put it? This game is not a simple game; it's a story in its own right, an adventure that you can experience in many different ways: - It is very pleasant to do the different campaigns with your friends, to discover varied and magnificent universes, you get attached to the characters and It feels good ♥ - The advanced PvE side (Raids, Assaults, etc.) is excellent, there is this spirit of victory that we want to achieve, the final boss we struggle with (but that's what we likes), always with a believable and exciting Lore. - PvP for those who like to put their heads up, unfortunately it's a bit off balance as those with better weapons and better stuff tend to win more often: / It's also a shame that some exotic quests can't be completed without PvP as some players like me don't really like it. - Quests and contracts, one aspect that keeps the game alive in the long term, there is ALWAYS something to do with the game and it is satisfying. Finally I will say that if you play the game a lot and you are motivated to spend hours on it, take the Season Pass (for only 10 €) and you will not regret it! This game has an unlimited lifespan (DLC announced until 2022 by Bungie: D) and it will appeal to many of you :) "}

{"text" : "You embody the skin of Monroe, a 10-year-old orphan who finds himself in a fantasy world that, in some way, is closely linked to his late mother who had the curious habit of painting pictures, many, many, but who never came to finish them. In The Unfinished Swan there is only one way of interacting with the scenario, a button where your character casts drops of paint and, through it, the whole game unfolds. In the beginning it is as if you are lost in the dark, groping the walls to locate yourself, but instead of being in the dark, No shadows, colors or anything that can indicate your location or give you a spatial notion. to then discover how to move forward, solve the most different puzzles and advance through this fantasy world. As the game progresses, new ways of applying this mechanics emerge, puzzles gain new contours and all this contributes to the game not generating a feeling of repetition. The scenarios also change, gradually gain more details and become completely different from what you found at the beginning of the game. Evolution in art goes hand in hand with this fairy tale lived by Monroe, directly reflecting the history of this kingdom and the characters who live in it. Having been, The Unfinished Swan arrives on the Steam platform after 8 years of waiting, with graphics that are not surprising for the current generation, but that are beautiful and perfectly fulfill the game's proposal; as well as the soundtrack, which is subtle, sometimes barely noticeable, but which matches well with the style of gameplay and immerses you in history. Even though it does not have the technical qualities and a story as captivating as those that its successor (What Remains of Edith Finch) has, the experience of playing The Unfinished Swan is very similar; He has a focus more focused on puzzles and problem solving, but which, like his successor, also has narrative as the guiding thread of everything.

The characters are made with high quality, the only 2 two questions concern Ermy and sisters. Why is everyone avoiding him in that new class? Is he such a Hikkan that he is not accepted automatically in new societies? And why do we need a sister? Talk about letters? A useless role, personally I don't see any point in it. The music is good, does not eat in, does not interfere with reading. The art is beautiful, there is something to see.

{"text" : "The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is undoubtedly one of the best RPGs I have played. From the very beginning, the plot draws us in like a swamp, along with the main characters and those who accompany us in side quests. The game contains a lot of difficult decisions, where you often have to choose a greater or lesser evil. The game world is beautiful, but unfortunately it is closed. In my opinion, exploration is inconvenient, because you have to press the mouse button all the time to jump on a stupid rock. The same applies to opening doors, etc. The armor is a bit too little, the weapons are better, but still weak compared to other games of this genre. As always, the soundtrack is great and atmospheric. In my opinion, it is worth playing because it is a very good title. I recommend! :) "}

{"text" : "Remember the Star Wars Episode 1 Racer N64 title? Well this is a modern approach to create a more full-fledged 800+kph experience. There are three ways to play the game; Online, Quick Race or Career mode where you aim to become the very best ‘Redout Racer’. Don’t expect any genuine story to this game; it’s all about the pure racing experience against your friends or Ai which are fiercely competitive. Don’t be too overconfident in corners as you will end up gliding into the walls damaging your vehicle. First off the detail, the game creates a detailed yet arcade backdrop experience with wide open racetracks to enjoy. The vehicles dynamically change to visually show aerodynamic changes to downforce and flight adding to the immersive racing experience. Everything is detailed from the neon lights to the reflective elements on the vehicles with scenery changing rapidly as you travel over 800kph this game is soaking in fast visual depth you simply can’t stop loving it! Racing in this game is unlike any other current racing game, every corner you’ll take different approaches rationally, challenge yourself and vehicle, pushing to the limit making the most of any moment. It’s a visual tribute to what racing games should and can become without the stereotypical real world limitations. Races are quick relative to competitive racing titles, but this is only an arcade racer. Although damage can put you out of a race the game doesn’t quite have the depth that a realistic racer would offer such as dynamic damage. Redout would really be something if your wing would get broken off or a booster flew off when damaged just like my nostalgic self expects from N64 but that’s just me. This game also have an element of racing management; using boost when the time is right, take corners slow to avoid hitting walls with an element of health which takes a few races to get used to whilst pushing to beat personal records and reach new speeds. Furthermore, you can control the height in which the racer levitates off the ground to utilise downforce or lift when overcoming loops and with boost points this game really takes some skill to master. In the career mode there are several types of races including Arena Race, Pure Race, Elimination, Time Attack and Tournament all which incentivise you to race by a level-class system with virtual dollars. As you work your way through this mode you’ll unlock vehicles from new classes to buy each with unique traits from different racing teams. Vehicles can be upgraded and liveries can be selected with Steam In-Game items which drop whilst playing the game. All racing modes are self-explanatory except arena race which is based on whoever gets the fastest lap under race like conditions. The progression in this game engages you to play more especially with the fast-reaction nature of this title to push to go faster, be faster and race cleaner. Each track takes time to learn with some blind corners making clean racing challenging for the first time but the in-race tutorial is helpful  to the credit and this can be all overcome with some genuine practice. This game is fast, fun and full of entertainment value, remember to push yourself, race faster, smarter and learn the tracks. However, if you haven’t played any racing game before or have little experience then I’d recommend looking elsewhere first then coming back to buy this fantastic game. If you are an avid arcade racing fan like myself who loves to progress as a driver, build your own racing machine, beat personal records and friends then this game is for you. This game was provided to me by Yolo Army but that does not influence this review in any way. "}

{"text" : ""Rebirth of Amnesia" is the true sequel of "Dark Descendants of Amnesia". He extended the content mentioned in the first generation of games, and also mentioned some descriptions of a generation of game events in Rebirth. Although many years have passed, the Frictional team is still handy in the production of horror games. The game still brings players an excellent horror experience in the rendering of the storyline atmosphere. In the game, the long and dark caves, scattered and collapsed roads, and dark and gloomy corridors, accompanied by ghostly low moans, directly fill the player's fear experience. Frictional aims to create a terrifying world and draw players into this situation. In the game, the protagonist Tasi woke up due to a plane crash and found that he was alone in the Algerian desert, and the flashbacks that evoked where he passed while exploring filled the missing memory in his mind. The story of the game progresses layer by layer, including the mysteries of various supernatural elements and multiple time and space that occurred around Tasi are gradually solved. It is worth mentioning that the description of the Algerian event in this game is also mentioned in a generation of text messages. Inheriting the setting of a generation, the san value will continue to decrease in the dark, and with the decrease of the san value, a terrifying picture will flash in front of your eyes. When it is completely invaded by darkness, it will enter a QTE stage and randomly resurrect at a nearby bright spot. Matches and oil lamps for lighting can also be collected and supplemented in the map as consumables. As long as it saves "100 million" points, it can barely be supported. The puzzle-solving factors in the game are also arranged reasonably. It will be designed according to the game plot, rather than the difficult puzzles designed specifically for understanding the puzzles. After all, it is the hardest puzzle in the game to discredit me when I go off the road. Hearing ghosts in the dark is still lost enough to play. I scared myself, Frictional is not just blowing. Although Frictional strives to create a more memorable experience for players, it is still difficult to surpass the pioneering work of Dark Invasion. Rebirth focuses on depicting a sense of horror in the atmosphere, but ignores the player's gaming experience. Simply touching the black and running pictures is more likely to cause fatigue. But these do not affect it. It is still an excellent horror game. The fascinating plot and the eerie and eerie music have left a deep impression on me. The slack and degree of horror is also easier for horror game novices to accept. "}

You got your mysterious island, some tribal people who greet you with spears and bows, and some basic crafting and building to survive. Of course it's not all the same; I haven't gotten too far into the story, but obviously there's a different tale here.  There's also some interesting survival mechanics.  For one, the health/food system, where you need a varied diet for full health.  You also need different treatments to wounds, depending on the type of wound, toxins, infections etc. And check yourself for leeches regularly.

{"text" : "Souls in 2D. And I could stop there. Apart from the camera, probably no game is as close to From Software's production as this one. The differences are small and you can say that where the developers wanted to differentiate a bit, it was worse - like a development tree, which is huge, but the distribution of skills there is bizarre (by targeting the rogue, I wanted to develop more damage dexterity, and to use better knives, I had to raise mainly stamina). Restricting access to NPCs by figures and only a few slots per temple was annoying. And the bosses, although they look good and they differ, the fights are similar - here I was suffering from the lack of the third dimension. For example, we could add a second or third plan and jump between them, it could be interesting. ... but I won't just complain. I had almost as much fun as with the DS series. The same feeling when you defeat some more difficult enemy or finally find a place to rest. Map and various shortcuts to other places. And this climate in general. Backed up by a great soundtrack and small things like different kinds of "estuses" depending on where we got them from. The game is addictive and you want to come back to it, and this is the most important thing. A must-see for Soulslike fans. "}

If I compare it to the first game in general. -Controls became more fluid. -Craft system has been developed. If you want to improve your weapons or equipment, hunting has become a part of the game, you have to hunt. It is now possible to craft with a single button even during combat. Grave puzzles are very enjoyable. It is neither too easy nor too hard to drive you crazy, just right. -It offers freer gameplay. Again, there is no open world, but the spaces are larger designed and well filled. You look at every corner. In short, it is a production that every player who deserves his money and loves the genre should play. 9/10 "}

At the age of 10 at school, he drew locations in a notebook, presenting Fallout 3, which has not yet been released. At the age of 16, he became interested in creating modifications for the game. When I was 19, I started to cut FOnline. At 26, he reached the age of Chris Avellone during the creation of Fallout 2 and realized his insignificance and that he had not achieved anything in his life.

{"text" : "This game truly is amazing. I was playing Assassins Creed Syndicate around the same time I was playing this, and Sands of Time kept me more engaged and interested in the gameplay then Syndicate did. The platforming is fantastic. You wall run and backflip in order to solve puzzles, not just for the sake of looking cool. But damn you look cool. It's been what, 14 years since this games original release? Because of this there are some things that haven't aged too well. At times enemies can be extremely annoying, circiling around and stabbing you every time you manage to get off the ground. It also annoyed me at first that after every battle the prince had a little cutscene of him putting away his swords. At times this became useful in knowing when all enemies were dead, but it is still a pain. Dialogue (mostly from Farah) is sometimes very faint and hard to hear. But really, other then these few things I feel like the game has aged well. To all those stating this game has no controller support and is a poor port: My Xbox 360 gamepad worked fine, I just had to bind everything and use mouse for the main menu. There are a few issues with graphics and glitches and to fix them you can find guides in the community hub. The main issue is just that you need to probably enable vsync. I would defintely recommend this game to anyone interested in the series. The ending surprised me at how good it was. Time to play Warrior Within. "}

{"text" : "I was intrigued by   when Funcom first announced it, and bought it instantly on launch day. I played a bit of single player, learned the mechanics, figured out it worked, even  And then I kind of tapered off for a while. Several updates later, a friend hosted a server, so I started the game again and joined hers, played with people, spent many hours in it. And tapered off again. Now here we are in full release, and my 24’ish hours in early access has now ballooned to 94.4 (as of this review), the vast majority of which has been on a server I’m hosting. I’m enjoying pretty much every change they’ve made since early access. I wouldn’t go as far to say that   is an early access success story, but it’s a damn good improvement. Graphically, the game looks fairly similar to how it did in early access. The engine is the same, but it’s been tweaked. Things have more polish, the animations are more fluid, the world has more detail, and the new biome is well done and adds a good extra layer of gameplay. Audio remains largely the same, from sound effects to the grunts and groans. There has been a fair amount of voice acting added as well, mainly to the quest NPCs and the people you can talk with. Combat sounds are still meh, and the thwacks and thumps of weapons connecting with enemies still isn’t all that satisfying. Gameplay has changed a lot, mainly for the better. The UI is more polished, although filtering through all the items you can craft in your inventory is still a chore, especially as you unlock more and more. Combat isn’t as clunky as it used to be, and can actually present a challenge, however you’re still able to circle strafe around some enemies (namely animals) and attack them while they’re unable to hit you. Temperature plays an important factor. You might need to wear some heavy armor for the snow biome to keep you warm, but venture into the desert with that armor on and you’ll quickly overheat. There’s a thin layer of strategy in how you go about doing certain things. Building is still where the game shines, especially once you get to tier three and you can build some extremely complicated but effective and gorgeous layouts. Capturing and training thralls is still a process, and still janky, at that. The recently added quests and journey keep you on a path in case you get bored of building. The dungeons present a good challenge, as do some of the world bosses. Network backend is much improved, too. I can’t speak for the official Funcom servers, but private servers do not have anywhere near as much latency, rubberbanding, or other issues they did for a lot of early access. And since the game is now released, there aren’t as many frequent updates, meaning you won’t need to restart your server that much, sometimes several times per day as it used to be. All in all, Funcom has done an excellent job bringing   through its early access journey into full release. They’ve continually updated the game, and seem to fix most things people have major issues with. It has one of the better building mechanics of a survival sandbox game, one which you can get lost in for hours upon hours upon hours. Well worth your time, attention and money. "}

Very colorful accidents that can be avoided by rewinding time (and you will have to get into accidents often). Most of the negative reviews are due to "bad physics" and "bad management". In my opinion, the game is doing very well with this. Everything is very realistic. Without such physics and controls, the game would be very boring. And it's like the highlight of the game. When playing on the steering wheel with pedals, you have to always play with the gas and the brake, I thought that the steering wheel would generally break from such very frequent, sharp and strong movements (when in many arcades you can simply hold the gas and drive without straining the steering wheel where the turn leads). As for the plot, everything is fine here too, in my opinion. Conclusion: I recommend buying the game only if you have a steering wheel.

Regardless of the plot of the game, the most fun of this game is its weapon system and the dubbing in the market! The whole universe speaks Chinese, some planets are in Henan dialect: "I tmd kill you tortoise grandson!", there are Sichuan dialects, and Shandong accents. The hand-feeling of the weapons with big brains is different. I personally like wasteland punk, rock and roll styles! So 10/10! If you like to play cool FPS, get it! This is really cool! "}

{"text" : "Ni no Kuni ™ II: Revenant Kingdom is an action RPG developed by Level-5 and published by Bandai Namco, despite being a sequel to the first game, it is not necessary to play the first Ni no Kuni, the story goes on for hundreds of years predecessor and few references are made throughout history. The main character is called Evan Pettiwhisker Tildrum, who has just become king of Ding Dong Dell a few months after his father's death, does not last long and the young king suffers a blow and ends up having the throne usurped by his deceased advisor father, with the help of a mysterious character, Evan escapes with life from the castle and has the idea of ​​building his own kingdom, as if that were not enough, the idea becomes more ambitious, unifying all kingdoms into one, the objective it is to build a kingdom where peace reigned. Despite the game being an action RPG, the combat is a hack n slash without any kind of complex combo, weak attack, strong attack, ranged attack, magic, roll and assistance from the higgledies, which are a kind of minions, there are a hundred of them in the game, with variations of elements and special moves, but only 4 can be selectable in battle. Near the end of the campaign, other fighting styles are released, counter-attacks, adding powerful magic, expanding the tactics of the higgledies and technological tools to decimate several enemies, but only for those who buy the DLCs. The construction of Evan's castle is fundamental in the story and directly impacts the gameplay, recruiting citizens, resource centers are released for construction, in which it is possible to release new combat skills, items, passable skills, building weapons, equipment, accessories, spells , etc. Adventure Pack - expansion with 10 more floors of the Faraway Forest Cave dungeon, from 30 to 40 floors, this is the most difficult dungeon in the base game, in addition, another super boss is included in the game. Lair of the Lost Lord: Labyrinth with 100 floors containing the best equipment in the game in chests, slightly higher difficulty compared to the DLC Adventure Pack. Addition of two fighting styles to increase the fighting arsenal. Tale of a Timeless Tome: DLC with direct connection to the first Ni no Kuni, addition of a super boss, + two fighting styles, inclusion of an arena composed of 3 to 5 floors full of common enemies and bosses with an immeasurable amount of HP , is the maximum difficulty of the game, without a doubt it is the response of the producers to those who complained about the lack of difficulty of the base game. Ni no Kuni ™ II: Revenant Kingdom's story is only good if you are 5 years old, the beginning is boring, the knockdowns in battles are frustrating at the beginning of the game, as the skills and items to get around the situation are released much more ahead of the campaign. The game does not offer any difficulty in the campaign playing in "normal", but the difficulty can be changed at any time in the menu to "Difficult" or "Extreme", in compensation for the difficulty of the last DLC: Tale of a Timeless Tome is insane, to complete the arena's challenges you need to have the best equipment in the game and appeal with the best spells. Despite these problems, the artistic direction is exceptional, the amount of collectibles is huge, the system of building the kingdom works very well, you really notice the impacts of evolution in all aspects. I recommend this game for anyone who likes RPG and likes the grind system, if you buy expecting a good story you will be disappointed. "}

{"text" : "At first glance it would be easy to write off   as a   clone with guns but that would be doing it a great disservice. Its got all the FromSoftware hallmarks from interconnected levels that open up the more you explore, it has the brutal crushing difficulty that initially seems steep until you learn each enemies attack patterns and placements and it has deeply challenging but rewarding boss encounters that will put all your acquired skills to their utmost test. I also loved that the same sense of apprehension and dread would build when I was about to face a boss in   which is one of the things I absolutely adore about the "Soulsborne" games from From.  In fact a lot of   could easily fit into FromSoftware's wheelhouse but the buck doesn't just stop there because   is more than that as is pulls inspiration and the best bits from a multitude of other titles such as  ,  ,  . You would think that with all these ingredients in the pot, somewhere something would go wrong, but I am happy to report that Gunfire Games have absolutely nailed it with  .   has quickly become a new favourite that I can see myself continuously revisiting over the years. Gunplay in   is absolutely terrific. There are a multitude of weapons you can pick up throughout the course of the game and upgrade and each has a force and kick behind them. You can feel the weight differences of a pistol vs a submachine gun vs a bludgeoning hammer. The one thing that immediately struck me is how well put together the combat is. It's not clunky in the slightest and feels fluid and fast as you switch in and out of any of the three weapons you are able to carry. Much like in   you can aim at various body parts of enemies and take them out watching them crawl to you after you capped them at the knees.   also employs a perk system like   and there are lot of the perks on offer, offering interesting ways to flesh out your character as you see fit. These perks are often found or unlocked as you progress through the campaign or depending on certain actions you carry out in game (example applying a status effect to 100 enemies will unlock the "Tormentor" perk). For a budget title I have come away immensely impressed. Graphically the game isn't going to set the world on fire.   isn't a game you are going to be playing for striking AAA graphics as it's a budget title and Gunfire have done a perfectly serviceable job here as most of it is easy on the eye. When it comes to replay value,   excels even further as some areas, with bosses and including items and guns, will not be generated in your first playthrough. In fact if you want to see everything   has to offer you will need to reroll the campaign several times. If you are pressed for time you can activate adventure mode which will slim down the campaign of the world you are in considerably and is a great addition for those who want to dive in and out if they don't have time on their side. I am generally very wary of games that are 3/4 player co-op but mention they can be played in single player. Most of the games I have played with these types of mechanics always tend to slant in favour of co-op making the single player a frustrating mess to move through. It's refreshing to see   buck that trend, as   is just as easily playable in single-player as it is in co-op. Which brings us to co-op. If you enjoy playing games with some mates on a Friday night with beer in hand, then this is definitely your game. I would go as far to say that this has been one of the best co-op games I have had the pleasure of playing. I had so much fun playing   with my mate Ben and I can't wait for us to return and reroll the campaign together. While   is a pastiche of other games, it's a near flawless one when it comes to execution, fun factor and enjoyment. Kudos to Gunfire Games because they clearly had a distinct vision they were aiming to achieve and by all means they have mostly accomplished this. This is a lovechild that has taken inspiration from  ,  ,  ,   and succeeded admirably. On paper this mash-up probably shouldn't have worked as well as it does here but surprisingly it does. Games don't come more solid and alluring than this. While at times   may be a cruel mistress, she certainly knows how to satisfy. Highly recommended.  Please keep adding worlds to the labyrinth via DLC. Pretty please! "}

{"text" : "I played it because it was distributed at Indie Gala. Since I couldn't proceed from Chapter 4 due to a crash, I will review the contents up to Chapter 3. A value FPS that opens the way with just a sniper, wearing a ghillie suit and using only a sniper rifle M40A4, a handgun M9, and a knife as weapons. The first chapter was going through the woods, but in the second chapter it was an urban warfare and it was different from subtitles. The sniper itself is easy because the enemy doesn't move until you find it. And it's easy to find because allies shout Enemy spotted and display the position on the minimap. Even so, I can't get rid of it because it's unbushed, there are enemies in unexpected positions, and there are traps that are hard to notice. The health system uses a health pack placed at an enemy base or mount to recover. I have a health pack from the beginning, and I can stock about 10 of them. Always acting with one ally, each ally also has its own health and four health packs. If an ally is killed, the game is over, so care for the ally is also necessary. Note that ammo is placed as an item at the base rather than stealing it from the enemy. Anyway, there are many crashes. There is a mysterious specification that somehow a screenshot of Steam is taken when jumping with the space key. Addendum: The installed Lithtech.exe did not crash when running in XP SP2 compatibility mode. I recommend you do it. I'm tired of taking screenshots, so I'll cut the Steam overlay as well. Addendum 2: The soundtrack can be ripped in the following ways. Open game.rez in Dragon UnPACKer () or WinRez LT Studio (). Unzip the file with the .WVP extension in the MUSIC folder and change the extension to .WAV. In short, it runs on a Lithtech engine. "}

But I got all achievements on one try; playtime of 6 hours.  Two thumbs up! Note: there are some really nice cut-scenes.  They are brief, so they don't drag down the story, and they are well drawn and animated.   Also: there were no collectibles, so you can zip through the game without a walk-through.  The game also avoids moon-logic by saying things like "this requires a spade," or "I really need a hack-saw here."

{"text" : "I liked how the developers talk about the characters and how these characters joke with each other. We are shown a nerd-botanist who knows everything, but is not afraid to give the enemy a bullet in the forehead, they show a daring and brave Jew who jokes about mothers and stuff like that. It looks very realistic, I quite believe that real guys in the real Second World War could joke and laugh in such a way in order to drown out fear and worries. Nevertheless, they understood where they were going and what awaited them there. Of course, each character does not have a well-developed storyline, and if you think that they will show you a movie right here, then no, nothing like that. And not without wild clichés, from which I want to take a letter directly and write to developments. If you look at all the cutscenes of the game, read all the dialogues and generally look at the picture of the game, you will notice that only two of the other fronts were indicated there - Great Britain and the French. That is, for the entire game about the Second World War, we will never be told about the USSR and its contribution to victory. This is especially offensive, because after completing the game, you get the feeling that the Americans think they won this war themselves. In the game, the graphics are very attractive, it was very pleasing, although some points were still not pleasant. Let's start with the fact that there is just a darkness of effects and sounds - how the weapon shoots, how the barrel dangles while running, how the sight sways, how the picture is felt in front of your eyes. This is all done at a very high level and the feeling from playing such a beautiful game is the most positive, you really have the impression that you are playing a modern shooter, at the same time a top-level one. I love beautiful games and separately it was nice to play storming Normandy in a new look - I still remember how the sand and hedgehogs looked in that distant Call of Duty, but now they give me the same feeling, only in a more colorful version and I really liked it. The immersion turns out to be real, full and deep, the world is worked out to the smallest detail, the twig sways and the water in the puddle reflects the sky. But, of course, there are some points that I didn't really like. I would not say that this is a direct drawback, but it is still worth noting. The levels here are not built with an emphasis on openness, which is why you come across moments of disappointment - you run like this down the street, around the burned-out houses, you see all this beauty and want to come closer in order to see what else is beautiful, but no - the level ends and separates you from the scenery with something like a fence. I repeat, no one demands a huge world from this game, I just wanted to look into the windows of a burning building, but they didn’t let me. Sadness. The developers of the game tried and did what the players asked - they returned the series to the beginning, to the war that hooked us all and which is still the most terrible thing that humanity has seen. We are again armed with this horror, and somehow even if we forget that this is a game and think what really happened to real people, then goosebumps immediately. This is exactly what we want from the game - emotions and these emotions are given to us with a margin. The scene where American soldiers decide to save a German girl, albeit not entirely logical, is that scene when our hero pulls his wounded friend across the entire battlefield, exhausted from pain and fatigue. It's cool, it's emotional and you want to play it, moreover, many times. Overall, WWII looks surprisingly cheerful. Undoubtedly, nostalgia helped the game, but its creators managed to skillfully take advantage of this. Despite the fact that the game has enough flaws, it can give you that same feeling of nostalgia for the very first parts of the series. "}

LOL, "By purchasing this kit, you will save 10167 rubles." - it was worth taking just because of this =) About the game itself: most of all it resembles Brawlhalla or Super Smash Bros., only the view is not from the side. Battles 3 on 3. First we save the blow, then we finish it off. 2 modes: up to 3 kills and point defense. The plot is in the form of rollers mostly. The eye does not hurt, does not distract, for a fighting game-norms. It's a pity, there are no paths to slide along like in the classics ... And I would add battles with a 1v1 rating, although 3v3 is more interesting, of course. The game is beautiful if the computer pulls. But the optimization is clearly suffering ... They say it lags ...

But is planet earth unfamiliar now? No! The robots that humans have built and bought to support themselves in everyday life, in medicine and in government, now inhabit the planet, amidst the old houses and possessions of the people. All robots are controlled by the mysterious company USS Corporation with the aim of creating a perfect, harmonized ideal society, which, unlike humans, would not even think of annihilating one another. But even though it is a world full of emotionless and lifeless tin cans, some specimens seem to develop human traits: For example RT-217NP, the protagonist of this game. This robot has managed to deactivate the automatic updates by USS Corporation and thus to tear itself away from its control in order to do its own thing and to explore the culture of the people a little, be it through curiosity about the human radio program or questioning everyday things Objects such as bicycles or crutches. The story of this game begins with the RT-217NP, at the beginning of the game he comes home from a city visit from which he has brought a battery, in the hope of getting the old radio of the previous human occupants working again get what actually works. However, when a recruitment call from the military ran in a loop, he put down the radio in disappointment and felt confirmed in his opinion that the human race was a barbaric people full of warmongers. After he has finished with the topic, our robot goes about its work and repairs the plasma cutter of a maintenance robot in the back room, which is also its "job" at the same time. However, when RT went to the charging station to recharge its energy, its peaceful everyday life was suddenly disrupted: a shuttle crashed near his house and left a trail of devastation. When RT enters the shuttle, he tries to save the last data from the pilot robot ... But what these data showed shook RT's world and a fight for the truth ensues. approx. 2.5 hours The game principle is similar to that of Life is Strange: It is, so to speak, a three-dimensional point'n'click game, which is seldom interrupted by (simple, but always wonderfully well implemented puzzles. Of course, that doesn't sound like anything the most exciting gameplay, but the principle fits the story perfectly. Since you are playing a "perfectly normal" robot designed for small repairs without any special skills, a shooter or a profound stealth game would simply make no sense. The story leads through the game and that Gameplay is more of a monotonous accessory - you just have to stand on it. What you should have besides this special taste is a relatively high tolerance limit for a bumpy technical implementation. You move quite statically and with generic animations through the scenes while a lack of camera control (yes, you always stay in the fixed, fixed image setting of the respective iligen place) does not exactly make it possible to really explore the places. As a result, a lot of flair, but also many details of this wonderful world are lost. Where much is lost is in the wonderfully written and equally well-set dialogues. If you have three different dialogs to choose from (you can finally click through several answers and questions as in Life is Strange, Mass Effect etc. pp.), You really have to choose one option - you should choose from three questions like “What am I doing here? ”,“ Who are you? ” and “What is my job”, you really have to make a final decision on one of these options, because although nothing should speak against the other questions, you can no longer ask them. The conversation is over, nothing can be repeated. You just let too much potential lie on the track ... + well thought-out, varied locations + good combination of vintage x cyberpunk + strong sounds, super mixed + super soundtrack + lots of joke through Easter eggs. Lots of Easter eggs. • no German dubbing, only subtitles • very simple translation - static animations - outdated textures (even for 2015) "}

{"text" : "What can be said about a game in which my companions are a dwarf whose rebellion against the empire almost cost him his life, an adorable and friendly girl who is possessed by a demon and a lizard who is a noble prince exiled for sleeping with a demon ... Wonderfull !!! Because I have not yet accumulated enough hours to give a well-argued analysis of the game and its history and to say that it has me trapped, it is without a doubt one of the RPGs with which I have been most hooked this year. From being able to create your character (or choose one with its origin already established in the game) to the great freedom of things and actions to be taken, whether it is killing every NPC that you come across to making such significant decisions that then have such a circumstantial impact on the development of history. Personalization is also a very positive point, due to the large number of classes and masters to choose from when improving the skills of the characters, if you get tired of the bow and the sword and want to choose magic you can do it. Each member of your group is key to a certain situation, each one brings their touch of humor and drama to each decision one makes. And the combat (very important point) is undoubtedly key here, because it is the turn-based combat of the old school RPGs, here no matter how strong or high lvl you are, you can easily lose if you do not manage your actions well. and skills each turn. Strategy and positioning are key in each one, of course if you want to ensure victory. In short, it is an engaging, long and very entertaining game that ensures hours and hours of vice and a challenging difficulty for new ones.

{"text" : "ONE PIECE PIRATE WARRIORS 3 One piece Pirate Warriors 3 tells the story of Monkey D Luffy and his companions, from the East Blue to the New World, arriving at the Dressrosa arch (which in turn is a filler for the game). The game has a huge variety of playable characters in which I have no way of making a list of each of them kk (just playing to find out). I never played Pirate Warriors 1 or 2, but I can say that this one is almost identical to the previous ones, the combat system divides opinions, some find it sickening, others have a lot of fun defeating the random ones (like me and.e). but in terms of character combos, it was sensational, each character has their respective fighting styles and you can make high combos, in addition to the taunt of each one being characteristic (Zoro, for example, uses his bandana when he presses Taunt). The game also has a feature called Kizuna Rush, which is nothing more than summoning your partner to help you, it is worth mentioning that when you use it, some special attributes are added to the character depending on who your partner is, for example, if you use Luffy with any of your gang, Kizuna has the bar extended duration, however if you use it with Sabo or Ace, the time is in slow motion among other variations, I also highlight that when using Kizuna, the character activates his Akuma's ability in Mi or Haki (Luffy, for example, uses Haoshoko no Haki when using Kizuna, and during use he also keeps his Second Gear active) and releases all combos while Kizuna is used. I leave here some pros and cons about the game. PROS: - Combos: As mentioned before, combos are vast and vary from character to character, it is always good to try to use other characters and see your fighting mode. - Characters: There is a good variety of characters, thus extending the playing time of each one who wants to test the characters. - Dream log: Basically parallel side missions, there are many missions in this log and it is quite fun. CONS: - Controls: Unfortunately this pc port is not configured to play on the Controller, which can be a headache for some, but nothing that some means of gambiarras do not solve, but this will only work on a controller, I tried set up two to play via remote with a friend, but I couldn't (if someone did it warns me, I'm grateful) - Online: Wouldn't it be a problem, if only I had Online, Ooorra Bandai? Was it difficult to put an Online in the game? as I mentioned before, I tried to play via remote play because that would be the only option to satisfy the desire to play with a friend, but the controls don't work, so forget it. - Graphic bug: this question is already mine, for some reason, my pc does not let the dolls in the correct way, most are normal, but some like Aokiji or Kuro, they keep their hair out of their bodies (if you get into my catches you can see the Bald Kuro kkk). Overall a great game, I took the base game for 20 reais, and I don't regret the purchase at all. Final verdict :: 8/10 I recommend it to everyone who is a fan of the work. "}

{"text" : "A great and beautiful game. I've 100% the entire game solo and clocked in about 30 hours. I barely touched Arcade and haven't played anything multiplayer or co-op. This game offers multiple ways to be played, and that's the best part. Want to be stealthy? Go ahead! Want to blow everything up? Do it! There are faults in this game, yes. I've experienced several bugs where, but none were game breaking. The bugs aren't very frustrating due to the game just being enjoyable and well done.  I'd also like to mention this game is beautiful. They did not go wrong when it came to graphics. The tower climbing has been removed and outposts have been redone. The outposts are a lot better and are much more thought out. The last thing I'd like to talk about is how this game has a lot going on. You can simply be driving on a secluded road and enemies after enemies will appear. I've had to just say "okay, I need to leave" a couple of times because it was difficult progressing due to all the enemies and events that were so close. Overall, this game is a must-play in my books. Definitely get on sale and try to get another friend to play it with you. It definitely offers a lot more than previous Far Crys have to offer, and it will keep you wanting to play it often. I've always found myself coming back and this will be "one of those games" that stays installed on my computer after completing it. Well done, Ubisoft. Don't ♥♥♥♥ up the next one. "}

As the game grew everyday, I found myself wanting to play it more and more and more. The creator, being that he is 17 years old, actually LISTENS to the community and works on this damn game everyday. He is brilliant for his age and is a really good role model for developers. Not a whole lot of games actually listen to the problems in the game or actually take suggestions on how to make it better. That's one of the biggest reasons why I love this game so much. Sure, the graphics might not be pretty; but that has nothing to do with how good the mechanics are, or just the game in general. I SINCERELY recommend this game, especially since it's free to play. (except the 5$ USD gold upgrade. which is really freaking awesome xD) Seriously, if you don't play this; you need to. It's way better than DayZ in my opinion.

{"text" : "It was Sandro from home who gave me the game, saying "I think you will like it". I haven't let go since. Superflight is a game that manages to find a perfect balance between sensations, risk taking and relaxation. I think it has to do with the famous flow, that state where a great calm comes over you as you slaughter mafiosi with bat in Miami Hotline or level up in Super Meat Boy. And Superflight manages to give you free rein on how to manage your flow. You can, in the same game, chain risky sessions that bring a big score, then move on to gliding, by turning outside the structures of the game. The title is quite refined, it is nothing of the to say, in spite of everything one is lost with pleasure in its levels generated randomly. If you like a level, we can save it to reuse it more ♥♥♥♥. If it doesn't, just dive into the mist to reappear elsewhere. The game's only flaw (if we exclude its graphics, which we must admit are minimalist), it has no soundtrack, other than the ambient noise and the wind. Personally, I found a solution that has become part of the game: I launch my spotify playlist. I am no longer considering playing the game without external music. She really carries the game. Imagine playing Wipeout, Hotline Miami or Furi without music: that would be special. And I see that the music I listen to influences my way of flying, the risk-taking depending on the track, the more planing flights or even voluntary suicide if I come across a piece by Johnny. "}

{"text" : "Half-Life 2 was released in 2004. After completing the game, I have a positive impression. After passing through, I immediately wanted to refresh my memory and remember how it all began. Launching the first Half-Life, to my disappointment, I immediately began to hate the graphics and the "modernity" of the game as a whole. Still, after playing on Source, I didn't want to play something much lower quality at all. At the same time, the obsession came to mind that the game would be re-released. More precisely, they have already begun to do this. In that era of game development, remasters were not at all popular as, for example, in the last 5 years. But the development really started - in the same 2004. After 4 years, this information reached me, and it seems that the first trailer for the game appeared. I will not retell the stages of the development of the game, understand the differences between Black Mesa and the original. The review is devoted to a standalone game that does not require "an introduction to the course". Some people think that paying for a game, which is basically free modification, is somehow wrong. In reality, this is a small reward for many years and persistent (I will note this point) work of independent developers. The product came out on the top five in the form of a modification. Hard work is felt in every centimeter of the playing space, in every model, button, LED. The Source engine was squeezed to the maximum. The color scheme is balanced and calibrated. To all the advantages of the design work, it is worth adding a special thanks to the composer Joel Nilsson, who managed to write not just another typical soundtrack, but a full-fledged instrumental album filled with melody and guitar riffs that fit the ear very evenly. The entire album is available for free download, which is kind of a hint. Despite the lack of official Russian localization, the plot of the game is transmitted directly through the events in which you participate personally. History is being written by you and before your very eyes. The developers took care of removing the logical inconsistencies of the original, too long locations. In other words, they managed to bring the project to the line of modernity, without deviating from the very foundation. Friends, it's just a pleasure to play it. For fans of statistics, the game contains achievements that, by the way, are not passed off as rudimentary shooting of ammunition, say, a revolver. Fans of Half-Life 2 and the general storyline will encounter familiar characters and facts. Someone will finally understand the moments that, due to the low quality of the original, were difficult to define. Therefore, despite the status of a remaster, the game is independent, high quality and enjoyable. I consider this to be one of the best remakes in game development history. Recommend. "}

{"text" : "An extremely useful RPG with interesting quests, plot and lore. It has not been so pleasant to play such games for a long time. The developers, a team of 20 people, managed to pull out such a good project for 40-50 hours (including pollock). With all this, the game does not have paid time savers, loot boxes and other donate gags that small indie studios like Pavilions and Yubisoft add to their games (although the latter seem to have understood that this policy will not lead them to good, YES HOW SO) The budget of the game for such a scale is not so large, which affects many animations, clashes with enemies (fortunately, many of them can be avoided thanks to diplomacy). To this can be added the monotony of the interiors and, perhaps, not the most suitable facial expressions for 2019 (and it is still better than in Andromeda). The game really has variability in many sides and story missions. The main character can add two partners to the journey (there are 5 of them). Each of them will have a pack of good-quality quests for the hero, after which you become attached to the companions of the protagonist and the attitude towards them changes (Siora top, incidentally). I strongly recommend this game for purchase, because it is precisely such developers who are ready to make it fit that need to be supported by the ruble. P.S 7.5 RENAIGSE from 10 P.P.S The game has a rich visual, and some landscapes and views on the desktop are not a sin "}

{"text" : "This game is great, with a huge potential, a really long and interesting story, challenging, encounter, a kingdom to manage, a map to explore and puzzles to solve... Now, to address the obvious issue: it is buggy, yes there are plenty of bugs at this point, but with careful saves most of them can be avoided. There are also design choices that can hinder the progression: a lot of loading times to go out of the throne room, loading time to meet advisor... About advisors: advisors are great with an interesting path of choice but loosing one is so detrimental to the game that you should be able to replace them. Having them dying, leaving because you don't agree to their choice, or any other reason can turn in a long agony, since you cannot react to events and upgrade your kingdom anymore. But did I say it is a long story? Bugs are to be expected when you have a lot of interdependent choices. Now that this is put aside, you get a story rich games based on well known mechanics. I did like the timers because you get this urge sensation that you are in the middle of a crumbling world, and even if you are trying to shape it, you cannot be everywhere. The story is great, not Manichean with plenty of choice. I never had a conversion where I liked no answer. Companions seem to get pretty interesting quests but I was only able to do a few. The map is huge with a lot of place to explore but traveling soon become a bit annoying and being able to enhance rads and buy horses or faster way of locomotion could be a good addition/mod. To conclude, the good point about bugs is I can play it once again and discover a lot of things bugs prevented me to see earlier, and once they will be patched, it will be among the best story rich game you can find.

{"text" : "I've been meaning to get this game for a long time. Now I finally had a chance to actually play it, and I must say I regretted not getting it sooner. There was not a single thing I did not like about To The Moon. The story is well-written, the soundtrack is simply amazing, and the art is fitting. The mechanics could have been better but nothing that's stopping me from thoroughly enjoying the game. John's dying wish is to go to the moon, and the doctors, Eva and Niel, are contracted to fulfill it. To do it, they need to dive into John's memory to find out the cause of that desire. The story uncovers as you gradually dig deeper into John's past one stage at a time. This is a nice reminder that story progression doesn't necessarily means going forward. The puzzle pieces start to fit together as you go, and you get to know more about the characters, all of which are likeable in their own ways. Although, I find it funny that while the story is supposed to revolve around John, I feel like River is the most developed character throughout the story. I slowly started to understand why she acted the way she did, what she really wanted, how her mind worked, and I felt more sympathetic towards her than any other character. But while it's all dramatic and emotional, it is balanced by the constant comic relief mostly by the dialogue exchanges between Eva and Niel. The art isn't at all remarkable but it complements the atmosphere of the story very well and I probably won't have it any other way. Despite the rather low quality, they make up for it by using appropriate visual effects and color schemes. Even the subtle sprite movements, such as the eyes and arms, can show you what the characters are thinking or feeling during certain events. The soundtrack is, like I mentioned earlier, simply amazing. Even the simple piano piece that John wrote for River was very soothing and fun to listen to. Overall, I really enjoyed playing this game and I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a game with good story. "}

{"text" : "I considered what I saw in a few moments played ... +/- 1 hour, but I will not evaluate the story presented. I have been playing video games for 20 years, in all this time I have never seen a game with this binaural audio thing and this is something that every game should start to implement, this is the future of audio. If you have a Dolby headphone, that technology that simulates 7.1 channels, this type of immersion is perfect and the game does it well (too much, you look back every 2 minutes) the immersion you have with it is too much. .. The graphics are worthy of a AAA of 200 reais, they are beautiful and are not heavy, I ran the game with everything on Very High with a gtx980 and an I57700k running it shouldn't be a problem. Photo mode was the most complete I've seen in games, I don't know if it's from the game or the geforce experience, you can capture a lot of beautiful things with very good camera details Again I say, I don't know about the story mode, but it seems me to be great and linear, and a totally new premise, since the main character hears voices (where the 3D audio comes in) But, after 1 hour of playing the game, I came up with the idea of ​​asking for a refund, not because the game is bad, far from it ... I recommend this game to anyone, but the real reason for the refund was that the game was massive in this aspect of 3d audio, I'm not a fan of horror games because they are too immersive, and that it's not a defect, it's very good, I don't like it ... This game uses immersion in such a perfect way that I, who am deaf in one ear, found it impressive. But this is massive and scary, if you keep the game volume low, you don’t have to worry about it, but then you don’t hear the narrator, and if you leave the game volume high to hear the narrator, these 3D voices torment you too much, and there is no way to turn them off or lower them, which would be perfect. Again, this is my fault, I do not like it, but the game is perfect, and I will only refund it for hours, I intend to buy it again to support the industry that made an exceptional game, worthy of a GOTY .. .I talked a lot about reimbursement, but I am considering not doing it, I really found the game very good and beautiful and I think I will enjoy the photo mode even with the game mutated. If you are looking for an immersive game, a little scary and beautiful, you can buy it without mercy, it is very worth it ... 9/10 "}

{"text" : "It's crude now, but the recent update fixed a lot of stuff, so I got high hopes for this one. Ghost hunting. Works best (if not only) with friends. Teams of up to 4 ghost hunters. Uses voice recognition, so you and the supernatural being can make peaceful communication, like: "John Doe, are you there? Give us a sign"  ,  . He then tires of the signs and starts to engage the team more directly, which takes the form of hunting. (In this case, you are the prey). All manner of light starts flickering, and the ghost prances about looking for someone to kill. Should they be close to you, an ever louder heartbeat can be heard. The sound of danger, of course. After playing the game, you get money. With money, comes better gear. With better gear, comes better ghost hunting. And with better ghost hunting, more fun. Not my type of game, I'm more of a single-player guy, but nonetheless, I would recommend this solely because it explores voice recognition which is... unprecedented? (pretend I didn't say that, Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes). Let's say rare, novel... interesting. No grades today. Happy hunting! "}

{"text" : "This is the best FallOut if this is your first FallOut! (c) I will say right away that I have been a fan of the series for more than 8 years, so I think my opinion is quite objective, although ... After the release of NV back in 2010, which was really good-looking (and the plot, and the gameplay, and even the graphics, seemed perfect at that time), which was very encouraging ... I prayed every day that the fish would please us with the fourth part, and now Bethesda heard my pleas ... Purchase, 100 hours of game time, and what in the end ... Let's start with pluses of the game: - Graphics (unless of course you play at maximum speed), but there is no telling, you need to see; - Sensible VATS, which you really want to use; - Skills! Now you can swing a character of a kind through certain branches, knowing perfectly well what exactly needs to be done to make a miracle merchant or a killing machine out of a Persian (plus cute skill icons); - A bunch of different locations, with kilograms of mobs; - Crafting and modifications. Finally, the developers have made a big emphasis on such a little thing, and have optimized it. A complete database of What How and What is crafted from is good news. - Armor. The ability to dress your character not in a full set, but in parts, adds a certain amount of realism to the game; Now let's go through the minuses: - The bold minus of the game is the main plot, it seemed to me somehow boring and primitive, there is no zest there. Moreover, for absolutely any faction, the tasks will be similar in meaning, which ultimately leads to a banal ending; - Dialogues. There are only four banal phrases for any cute story of any NPC, which, as a bae, shows not a high emotional range of our character; - Enemies. Well, here the developed ones have never been particularly creative, but still I wanted something new and unusual, there were a lot of raiders, ghouls and super mutants around ... you will be lucky if you meet the Queen of Swamps, who will plant you on claws in a second; - Side quests, and it's not even about their quality and interesting scenarios, but their quantity, in my opinion there are really few of them, and their whole point is bring or kill; Well, about the Construction and Establishment of settlements, there is suum cuique (to each his own). Someone enjoys sims in an RPG, but someone does not, in principle, this is not imposed in the game. In general, the conclusion is this: If the Storyline is not important for you in RPGs, and you just love to swear at locations and beat huge uncles with a crowbar, knock out cool loot and apat lvl, then this game is for you !!! Bet 7 out of 10 Brotherhood of Steel Tokens !!! And remember War ... War never changes ... "}

{"text" : "Great little game which has been lost in the sea of steam games. I grabbed this game about a year ago on sale and forgot about it. Recently i went back through my library and thought this looks like a fun little game with a catchy title ill give it a play. Between things for about 2 days i have played 30min sessions before i 100%ed it. Game is short but sweet and not too complex with your only actual movement control a grab button. Your character walks on his own and your goal is to grab the collectibles in the level and dodge the hazards while stages become more dangerous and complex along the way. There is 105 levels to play and in each level there are potion bottles as the main collectible and some stages also have a secondary collectible, a cog to unlock which can be used to skip other stages if you wish. There is also a bunch of heroes to unlock some which can be found in levels and others fused in the lab to make unique heroes. All the heroes are just cosmetic but they have really nice artwork so its more of a bonus, i played mostly as the hamburger monster thing dunno why but he was my go to. Overall the game is a short little puzzle game and id recommend people picking it up on sale if its your kinda thing and dont mind a bit of a casual game to waste a few hours in. "}

My reccomendations to improve this game is to: Make items less rare and scatter them all over chenarus, focus on fixing bugs more then adding new things to the game. Maybe lower the price a LITTLE bit because it is too much for the games current state at the moment. But at this time I still enjoyed the game. Hopefully i can see big improvements. "}

The experience from participating in the 7th closed beta as a pre-order bonus to the end of the game after hearing the news that the game was finally released today was really amazing. Let's see what's so amazing. Better than Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stralingrad/Rising Storm. The squad system has also changed! Each squad has a maximum of 6 people, and the number of squads is more than the previous one, so it is a little easier and easier to mark the firing point, and the Viet Cong team has a system like a spawn beacon of Battlefield, similar to a squad tunnel Because of this, the Viet Cong team can attack enemy occupied points more reliably. Also, vehicles have been created! helicopter! Transport helicopter! Attack helicopter! It is now possible to pour out 7.62 baptism, the gift of capitalism from heaven! jungle! Damn forest! Vietnamese red cubs hiding in them like cowards! Identifying Pia is damn difficult, but it's as damn easy to hide in it! That's why you don't know where the bullet is coming from and you have a high probability of getting behind it! I love the smell of a napalm in the morning.. Everyone must have heard of it at least once in the movie Apocalypse of Hell. Napalm bombing became possible. Except for the red pups hiding in the tunnel, all living things will shed their guts! Other than that, I don't know how many of you have seen pictures of U.S. and Korean soldiers who participated in the Vietnam War on Google without being a commander, but many soldiers said that they went to the battlefield with some slogans on their helmets, cigarette packs, and Ace cards used for playing card games. In addition, some soldiers said they had bullets, and some soldiers had their upper barrels on. You can do that here. Still, you'll only see the enemy as a big target, so don't even go to the upper barrel. Have you ever witnessed a chopper go down to the ground? You can witness it here! It's the beginning of the game, so let's move on to the mind that it will be patched someday. M16. Americi Cheeseburger A world cultural property created by Eating Mother Cuckoo. The M16 is finally here! AKM. Soviet red communist product of the Soviet Union. AKM also followed! M60. American pigs made by 90 pound weighting mother chucks. The M60 is also here! RPD. Potato Selling Bron-ㄲ Soviet bullying created by the hard mother chucks. Even the RPD has come! Still, don't grind it just because it's an automatic rifle. Booby Lab! It's a great tactic to use in the jungle where you can't be fooled! As long as the earth is destroyed tomorrow, these Viet Cong cubs must have laid booby traps or spears! This is another great military simulator. Just because an automated machine is in a row, it doesn't even let you down with two or more shots! When one hits the upper body, it collapses as if the hips are aching on the spot! And Napalm, M16, and M60 shooter on top When all of this is put together, the true value of Rising Storm 2: Vietnam, an American dream! It is recommended for those who like military simulations such as Arma 3 and those who like games in the Vietnam War! ps. Thanks matrixmod for the feedback! "}

{"text" : "Once the campaign is over, I go on to relate the pros and cons that I have found in this game: Pros: - Impressive graphics, it is true that you need a powerful PC, I recently updated the graphics card because it only works with graphics compatible with directx 11, be careful with this ... I have friends who have a grace card for 5-6 years, they have bought the game and it won't let them run it for this reason. As I said graphically it is simply impressive and the sound too, a great job, it looks like a movie, I have it in Ultra and there are moments that I have been "caught" seeing landscapes and details, you can see the captures in my profile. - Total immersion, the story is very well told and the visual aspect helps a lot, you start playing and do not stop until you finish it. - Very simple mechanics, you learn to play in 5 minutes, it is very intuitive. Cons: - All the combats are exactly the same, it is time and again to do the same thing, you handle the 2 keys and the mouse all the time, you can kill the enemies by looking at the ceiling. - Very easy, there are only 3 "bosses" in the whole game, the rest is to kill the same enemies over and over again, the variety is 4-5, they are clones of each other. - There are no side missions and it's not an open world, it's a shame because the mapping is great, a game like this with an open world and GTA-type side missions has to be spectacular. - Very short story, in 6 hours I have passed it ... now I will start the multiplayer. Do I recommend the purchase? * If you expect a challenge, do not buy it, you will spend it in an afternoon. * If you want to play a graphically impressive game with a good immersion and everything that has to do with ancient Rome attracts you, buy it without a doubt, that if, do not pay 39.99 euros, I caught him in the sales for 13 euros, a price more than fair in this case. Metacritic gives it 61%, I give it 70%. Has the experience been good? Yes. Did you expect much more? Too. "}

The game is just an incredible soundtrack, a good visual component (sometimes it seems a bit outdated, but still worthy) quite high complexity (if you are achivko-hunter) and famously twisted plot, built in the same locations in reverse order. Fans of stealth and RPG will like it, although the last component here goes to the second plan. "}

{"text" : "Why does everyone hate Rome 2 so much? Rome 2 has It's flaws just like any other game out there, and Isn't the first sequel to be inferior to It's predecessor, but It's still a good game nevertheless. There are many things wrong with Rome 2 in terms of what was promised, and the fact most of the DLC were factions, and units already in the game, but I like to judge Rome 2 on what it has rather than what it doesn't have. Rome 2 is your basic empire building game where you have a birds eye view of Europe to control your factions units, and cities. There are a variety of factions to choose from ranging from Rome, Carthage, The Iceni, and even Sparta. Once you have chosen your faction you then slowly build an empire, manage resources, fight battles, and take over land, and other factions. The game is fun, and the battles are sometimes intense. I can spend hours on this game doing many things. I love taking over factions, and making my faction have better technology, and economics. Rome 2 is a game where you spend hours at a time on. You need to be dedicated with your time, as the time I spent on my campaign was 250 hours. Rome 2 also has the steam workshop. At any time you get bored of Rome 2 you can always download extra content from the workshop to give you many more hours of the game. Being as Rome 2 can give you 500 hours worth of gameplay (If not more) it really Isn't a game you can speak ill of. I believe the critics are being hard on this game, and the worst total war game for me was 'Empire'. 'Empire' was by far the worst total war game ever, and I seriously recommend this game to anyone who loves to build an ancient empire. "}

{"text" : "Destination Primus Vita is a narrative, first-person and episodic puzzle game set in a science-fiction universe. Six characters – Austin, Hayao, Artemis, BrX, Geny and Coby – travel across the cosmos on the interstellar ship Beaufort, to retrieve water that was stolen from Earth hundreds of years ago by an alien species. Played from the perspective of one of those characters, this first episode of six stand alone titles focuses on Austin, and like everyone else Austin is in Cryosleep for the long journey through space. The player experiences Austin's actions through the character's dreams, which themselves are a construct created by NIM (the AI on the ship), designed to train them for their time on Primus Vita and to introduce them to the challenges they will face and the clues they must seek. Apparently this is based on a comic book, but it's not one I've ever heard of, and it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the game in any way, as the experience itself is one of discovery. Making your way through surreal environments loosely based around the Beaufort, you'll find yourself completing simple puzzles to unlock different areas, and hunting down clues to reveal the secrets of the other characters onboard. The primary gameplay loop consists of collecting clues dotted around a specific area – an office maybe, or an infirmary; even a poker club makes an appearance – which enhance your dreams by providing you with specific 'memories' from the real world, allowing you to live the moments of the past which the other characters on board the ship experienced. This deepens your relationships with those characters, as you can talk to them within the game, and select dialogue responses based on the clues you've put together and the scenes you've witnessed. The clues you need are largely just piece of the environment you need to click on to activate another character's dialogue, or replay a scene from their past. When you've finished an area, you move on to the next one, and more or less repeat the process. There are other parts to the gameplay, including action-led quick time events, but I don't want to spoil them or the story arc in this review. I have to say, the game's art direction looks great, even if the graphics are rather simple. As DPV takes place in a dream world, the level designers have taken real advantage of the freedom that brings: Expect Inception-style geometry wrap-arounds, strange environments floating in space, and scenery and characters which fill in around you as you search the environment. Bizarrely though, the animation budget only appears to have run to some lip syncing during characters' dialogue, as the cutscenes which play out for the characters you meet consist of the models being posed in different ways without any kind of animation between. It's hard to describe, but imagine you have a character on your screen which you can cycle through several pre-made poses. Well, it's exactly the same as that, and it's rather jarring. I've struggled for weeks to write a review of this game, and that's because there isn't much to say – there's a story I can't talk about for fear of spoiling it, and the game gives you the one loop which you do over and over in different environments: Finding clues and reliving other peoples memories from the perspective of a dream controlled by an AI. It's not really 'fun' to play, but it does have some unique mechanics and the sights you'll see on your travels can be wild and beautiful. What really kept me playing though is the story and the way it's told through the eyes of the characters you're on the ship with. They're all unique, if a little stereotyped, and it made me want to see it through to the end. The game scores slightly higher than it possibly deserves for also being a bargain at less than six quid – I've played worse games which were more expensive. So give it a try if you like the sound of the narrative and the world, because for that price you'll not be disappointed. 7/10 "}
{"text" : "Hands down the most original card role-playing game on the CCG scene today. It borrows some of the most iconic game mechanics and designs and adds wildly innovative gameplay variables. It is easy to learn to handle, but difficult to handle with excellence. The number of game planes to consider (table, hand, life, curve management, deck economy, hero abilities, etc.) makes each choice decisive. Beautiful in the artistic and practical in playability. It is currently in early access, so this is the ideal time to get started and begin unlocking collection. Last but not least, it has an official discord in which the developers constantly ask the community for feedback and provide excellent and close treatment. We could say that we are the community itself the "developing CEOs". I do not know can ask for more. The only handycap that should be warned you is that the social mass base of players is still scarce, and it will not be because of the amount of awards that the project has accumulated from its earliest stages. This aspect is already our thing, players. Hopefully, as soon as a ranked mode is implemented (which is being worked on), it will settle. "}

{"text" : "I don’t know why most of the reviewers had problems launching the game due to crazy GFWL, but everything went smoothly for me. Partly because of the reviews, I was waiting for an acceptable discount for this game. the picture with the performance of GFWL according to reviews was completely incomprehensible, and I was not familiar with the refund system. At the first start of the game, the in-game GFWL appeared and demanded to log in - logged in (the login took 10 seconds, the data from MS Account came up). Then he demanded to enter the game key - entered. Then he said that it was necessary to update the GFWL, followed by the restart of the game and updated. After restarting the game, you just had to tick the autologin checkbox and that's it. It starts up and logs in to GFWL quickly - while the introductory non-boiling EA screensaver is running. Everything was similar in GTA IV. One to one. Therefore, such a flurry of negative reviews about a non-working GFWL, I personally do not understand. Maybe you shouldn't have rushed to upgrade to Win10 if absolutely all new games work fine on 7-8.1 too? In addition, it is absolutely stupid to give a negative review to a game that does not work on an OS that is not specified in the system requirements. It's like complaining that JA2 doesn't work or works crookedly on Win7. Biased. Yes, GFWL is a trash and utter nonsense, but after having a chat with it once at the first start of the game, then you forget about it. The game itself lived up to expectations. It resembles both the Serious Sam series and somewhat Gears of War with different gameplay mechanics. Beautiful kills with scraps and tearing off heads, an original idea with a whip - throw enemies on the thorns or reinforcement, or beautifully finish them off in a layer. Simple, but interesting and funny in-game achievements for getting more XP. For example, shoot the enemy eggs, and then rip off his head, or the achievement "anal sex" - where you want to finish off the enemy with a shot in the fifth point. Well, exploding barrels tearing everything to shreds, which do not just stand in certain places - they can also be thrown into a crowd of enemies and blown up. There are no complaints about the graphics and setting. Nice and juicy picture, coupled with hurricane gameplay, is very delivering. Fast, colorful, hurricane and fun classic old school kill-em-all shooter. If you love shooters a la Serious Sam, I highly recommend giving it a try. Especially at a discount. You will definitely not regret it. "}

{"text" : "I didn’t encounter the so-called optimization problem... I just didn’t open DX12, WIN10 version 1903 first put aside the connection problem and release problem, mainly to talk about the design of the game that gave me the deepest impression-that is farming ------ -------------------------- farming can be understood as brushing. From the perspective of game history, since the task list system was moved into the game, farming has been a side product of the task list. This design has always existed and has even become the mainstream content of modern games. Daily, weekly, activities, and packaging emerge endlessly. Its characteristic is that players will always have endless tasks in the game, and new ones will appear after completing a task. It’s not just tasks that exist in the form of lists that are called task lists. From the “neighbor’s grandma asked you to kill 10 monsters” placed in the task floating window, this kind of task is very common in wow, to no master. In Land 3, the guidance from one location to another, from one boss to another boss, are actually task lists. But you will find that farming will only exist in the system with a task list. It is difficult to find traces of farming in early FC games, because it is difficult to give the player a farming task design in an absolute linear game, because the player cannot choose the game. Process, only those games that give players freedom will have traces of farming. As a crude and simple way to fill game time, everyone started designing farming content. As soon as everyone heard about the game, they said it must be a garbage game. In fact, this understanding is wrong. As long as the farming task is designed properly, the player will follow the design with peace of mind, instead of shouting and abandoning it. Whether the design of farming is appropriate depends on linking farming content to the core experience and the process is not boring. Many players always spurn the task of "the neighbor’s grandmother asked you to kill 10 monsters". In fact, there are many such tasks in Borderlands 3, but they just happen to be linked to the core experience of the game. Players are almost aware Less than. Although it is a shooting game from the perspective of the operation of Borderlands 3, it is actually a farming collection game from the core experience. Why do I follow the missions in the game, why do I get back to the spaceship after playing for a while, why the green equipment at the back level is better than my purple equipment, in fact, it is to stimulate players to get better equipment. Compared with the common mmorpg, Borderlands 3 just speeds up the process of equipment pursuit. It may take about ten minutes to swipe a hand, and you might be able to swipe it faster if you are equipped with it. Compared to the full 3 hours of using War Thunder, that’s really fast. What players are pursuing in the game is not the "reward and rewards brought by precise aiming" experience brought by traditional shooting games, but the "numerical feedback and joy of opening the box brought by new equipment". In fact, if the system design is split, it can be understood that every battle comes with a bonus round of drawing cards. Maybe this battle draws junk cards, or SSR. As a game unstable factor, players will willingly participate in this "gambling". And this gambling happens to be linked to the core experience of the game, so players don’t feel boring when brushing, because the rewards are uncertain, (in case it will happen) and there is another way to get higher rewards A sense of accomplishment (I got SSR). The uncertainty of this gambling lottery is much more interesting than the fixed reward of "killing 100 monsters to get SSR". Do you think you entered the game to fight the boss? Actually you went in and opened the box. Seeing the boss hiding fast, seeing the box running up. Of course, the lottery is only one point of optimizing the brushing experience. In order to ensure that players are not bored when brushing, the designer has also added a team system, as well as different level themes, processes, and certain game plots, and even There are puzzle solving (such as theater) and map exploration (such as boxes hidden in various corners to find with a little brain), which can ensure that the player is not boring in the process of each brushing. To give a counter example, such as Swipe in Far Cry, there are countless strongholds on the map waiting for me to do it, which is also a kind of task list. But what's the use of brushing these strongholds? Did I get a better weapon? Has my ability improved? What are the benefits for me if I use these locations? Maybe there is, but can you guarantee that I will get something new every time I brush a stronghold? It seems not. The rewards that Zelda gets every time he completes a temple are beneficial to the player, and each temple level is not repeated, and the player is willing to finish each temple. And each stronghold in Far Cry looks the same. Players may know that there is something inside before going to this stronghold, so why should I go to clean it. After getting better equipment, the efficiency of the player's brushing and brushing has been improved, and the player's brushing speed has been faster. Then the player is stimulated to go to the next round of brushing for better equipment, which constitutes a perfection The process loop. Therefore, in the system design, no other design can interrupt the player's core experience (swipe), so in Borderlands 3 you can see various designs to enhance this experience-ammunition that can be supplied everywhere And blood packs (a lot of them are too much, but the blood will automatically recover, I don’t understand why this design is); close death resurrection; death without punishment; automatic pick-up and so on. There are many designs for these, so I won’t list them all. Another problem in the game, what should I do with the garbage? This is a problem that many brush games have not handled well. What is the garbage produced in Land of Ignorance 3? Money, junk equipment, equipment I can't use. Someone may ask, what do you say, money is rubbish? If compared with the equipment players are pursuing in the game, money is really rubbish. Take a look at the products in the game that are designed to comfort players for not showing SSR out of the box, you will find that money is used to fool you, "You did not get SSR, I will give you some money/junk equipment to comfort you." Then there must be a place for garbage, okay, you say throw it away? This is not in line with the "maintenance of the core experience" mentioned earlier, which means that the garbage must also be useful to the player. In the game, the designer designed the sales function and the upgrade function to recycle the garbage, and the equipment I did not use, It can even give other players online, which perfectly solves the flow of garbage. From a design perspective, this is actually a game output loop. The last question is what to brush, what can be brushed, and what cannot be brushed. In fact, this question is discussing the player's game goals. Borderlands 3 is a shooting game. There are many types of guns that can be brushed, but there are more than just guns that can be brushed. Accessories can be brushed, weapon appearances can be brushed, character appearances can be brushed, money (more than one currency alone) can be brushed, vehicles can be brushed, skills can be brushed, and there are many things that can be brushed. This has resulted in players pursuing more than one goal, and the randomness of rewards and the diversity of game goals make the players never finish. Even if this one does not produce a gun, it can at least have some appearance or plug-ins. This kind of psychology puts the player in the process of repeated brushing. Therefore, the design of farming depends on how the designer packages and conceives. ---------------------------- It's been a long time since I played such an addictive brush game, let alone, I'm going to brush .

The armor designs look beautiful and the weapon mechanics feel great. Vehicle mechanics still need alot of work but that's to be expected in alpha phase.

Every 25 levels you can unlock another piece of the plot in the form of a beautifully animated video and get acquainted with the new characters of this story - the boy's mother, the mysterious sage and little Frankenstein, each of which will present you with a new set of buttons (default, chrome-plated, mother-of-pearl, in the form of stars and edible items). Greatly illustrated, it includes 13 interactive building models - from a farm and a mill to an observatory and a Ferris wheel - as well as 100 puzzle levels and 10 bonus puzzles highlighted in orange. In addition, the game has six tools, tied to the gameplay and requiring a lot of energy to activate, an intelligible and eight-point guide showing how to collect combinations of four and buttons. And the game also has an amazing one, in which you can clearly hear the notes of a tambourine, xylophone and piano, pretty, decorated in a plasticine style, two game modes (normal and relaxing), cards, Steam Cloud and two dozen difficult ones. Casual from the domestic, replete with colorful graphics, charismatic characters and original gameplay.

{"text" : "I'm a fan of the series. I started playing Fallout 3 and ended up having to try them all from 1 to 4. The game has bugs, yes many, but nothing that gets in the way of the gameplay. Preston is sometimes a pain in the ass, but he just wants to help people so we can reveal, but the most amazing thing about this game is how free it allows you to be. You can concentrate on completing the missions and see the "end" if that is your goal, but I personally love going out on the map looking at every little corner, and in Fallout 4 there are a lot of "little corners" to look at. It also works as a great occupational therapy, because settlements can consume hours and hours of your day if you are a very detailed person. I could write a lot about Fallout, but maybe it was less interesting than saying that the game has some flaws as I said at the beginning, nothing that can't be circumvented, but sometimes some quests need a "little push" to unlock, like when a talking about a character just doesn't happen or when the NPC is not where it should be, not to mention the many NPCs trapped between objects. Bethesda should really work on an improvement to the Creation Engine to fix these grotesque bugs. As much as they give their games a certain personality, it's still bad. Overall the game is very good, the post-nuclear war environment opens up a vast array of options for the game. The possibility of customizing weapons, armor, robots, companions and settlements, could be richer, but already allows you to create a unique game that brings a totally unique gaming experience for each player. The mods, oh the mods! It has mods for everything imaginable, the community is very active on this point, including fixing bugs in the game on its own. Anyway, Fallout 4 is an excellent purchase for those who want a little peace and quiet from multiplayers.

{"text" : "The remake of the classic gang story action shooting game "Four Seas Brothers" was finally officially released on September 25th. The author who has played Mafia 3 has always heard that the third generation is the worst performance of the series of games, but the first generation and The stories of the second generation are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and even related to each other, and the picture effects of the first generation after the remake are also very good in the trailer, and the details are better than the third generation. So the author took advantage of the holiday to quickly pass the "Four Sea Brothers 1 Final Edition". Overall, there are both bright spots and disappointments. Today, I will bring you my appreciation of the game. 1. Thorough remake brings cosmetic-level graphics and plot expressiveness. The first generation of Brothers of the Seas was released in 2002. It has a history of 18 years. The consoles that old players can play are still Sony PS2 and the original XBOX. , And now the PS5 and XSX consoles of the next era are ready to go. The remastered version of this game has stepped on the tail of the console of this generation. It is indeed a bit embarrassing at this time. Fortunately, after the complete remake of the game engine of this generation, the screen and characters of this game can be said to be completely new. The character's face is so fine that the pores and eyelashes are clearly visible, and the emotions of each character's smiles, emotions, anger, sorrow, and joy are all visible under motion capture technology. Moreover, this work does not completely copy the animation storyboards and character lines of the previous work, but uses the latest technology of the moment to adopt new character actions and scripts that are closer to reality, and get rid of the limitations of the old technology, such as Salieri and Tommy. The reaction animation of the grenade explosion in the hotel attack was re-interpreted, making the overall animation performance to a higher level. In addition, the light, shadow and scenery in the game are as beautiful as ray tracing is turned on. Whether it is the dazzling and dazzling first ray of sunlight in the forest in the morning, the soft and graceful red glow of the western sky in the evening, or the colorful neon lights on both sides of the street at night, It is also the blurred dream of the dim lights of the gentleman's club, which can give players a strong sense of beauty visually. Especially when it rains at night, the dense rain filaments envelope the entire city like an impermeable net, dim streetlights and car lights, as well as the player's sight, making people feel like they have entered a Hollywood dream. Coupled with the endless traffic and pedestrians on the road, the towering harbor bridge and row upon row of tall buildings, the news broadcasts of the vehicle radio and nostalgic jazz echoed in the ears, and the players driving the roadster with the revolver were instantly pulled back to the top In the 1930s, the United States was a place where urban gangs were prevalent and drunk. In addition, the game has also made a similar three-generation simulation in the interactive level. For example, the parts where the vehicle has collided will appear corresponding damage, the enemy will spray blood when the bullet hits, and the entire field of view will become red and red when the player's blood volume is too low. Blurred, the lights, roadblocks or fire hydrants on the road can be damaged or even sprayed with water jets. Even vehicles are equipped with an openable speed limiter to limit the maximum speed of players on different road sections. All of the above further strengthen the world. Reality and player immersion. It can be said that this work has really made a lot of effort in terms of graphic expression, and strives to bring players a Hollywood movie game experience. 2. New bottle of old wine, unchanging game core. Compared with the full-scale innovation of the screen performance, the gameplay shows its old school at the first hand. Although the game has constructed a vast fictional city "Lost Paradise", it did not redesign the mission according to the popular open world concept. Instead, it still follows the typical linear mission of the year, with a total of 20 chapters and one chapter connected. In the first chapter, there is no time for any side tasks. The types of missions mainly include robbery, gang fire, assassination, pursuit, escort, breakout, and stealth. Although there are various shooting scenes and fighting scenes, in most cases players need to play the protagonist. Mi’s old line-a taxi driver with a driving skill that is as good as a race driver, because not only the beginning and the end of most missions require the player to drive alone or carry the godfather and gang members or goods to the destination, but also the mission. When chasing down enemy gangs or getting rid of the police, the player can be as proficient as the Akina mountain car god. There is even a racing task that requires the player to directly defeat a dozen racers without any racing experience to win the first place. Debut is the pinnacle. It's really the Mafia chauffeur. However, although there are so many driving bridges in this game, the driving feel is not so satisfactory. Most of the vehicles used in the process turn awkwardly or accelerate, so that even if the protagonist becomes a local car god, he is often driven by The state of running or not catching up to the target. But what I want to praise is that the automatic navigation system of this work is as intimate as the third generation, and the small map will also mark the location of the roadblock or police car that can be used, so that the player can plan the route in advance. Next, let’s talk about the shooting and weapon systems of this game. The guns and melee weapons that players can use in the game are relatively limited. The melee is sticks and knives, while there are only 4 types of pistols and shotguns, submachine guns, and bolt-action rifles. And Lupala, coupled with throwable weapons, grenades and Molotov cocktails, it can be said that the arsenal of this work is not rich enough. And there is no upgrade system for each weapon, because the player only has a small pistol at the beginning of each mission. If you want to obtain the above weapons, you have to go to the weapon library to obtain them, and the player can carry up to two guns, melee weapons There are two weapons, one for each, and one for throwing weapons, so players often use two or three weapons in rotation during battle, which tends to be tedious. And the bunker shooting in this work has not kept up with the cutting-edge technology of the times. Shooting when sticking to the wall is often blocked by the angle and cannot be shot. It requires the player to move the protagonist's body to a certain angle outside the door to shoot. Easy to suffer from enemy fire. However, the game itself does not give players the ability to actively recover blood. The only way to recover blood during battle is to find a limited first aid kit nearby to replenish blood. However, under this mechanism, the remastered version adds a high-range sniper in some levels, so that the player will often be beaten to almost empty blood when he shows up, but the player does not have an effective long-range weapon to suppress it. The shooting experience is unspeakably refreshing. Players often need to hold back and try their best to destroy enemies one by one with a headshot. Like in the movie, the situation where the Mafia picks up a submachine gun and hides all the way frontally without hiding is almost non-existent in the game. 3. The high-quality plot is difficult to conceal the lack of freedom. The chapter setting and linear gameplay make the story very compact. Players only need less than 10 hours to watch the entire main story, but it also means that the game itself has no gameplay. The expansion of the degree of freedom, whether it is the protagonist’s RPG mechanism, or the gang’s skill upgrade or territory management mechanism, or the vehicle’s custom mechanism and enhancement mechanism, these basic gameplays that are common in other open world games are all in the remake No. The only thing that exists is the collection of various items, and the collection itself does not generate any gains to the player, and can only satisfy the pure desire to collect. For some Buddhist players, this may be good, but from the perspective of game design This kind of collection element lacking positive feedback is a bit tasteless, probably only the vehicle can make the author interested in doing a full collection. Therefore, although the remake has made full improvements in the graphics and plot performance, the reforms in the gameplay are still very conservative. There is still a significant gap between this work and the real top masterpiece. It can be said that this remake is the largest Regret. 4. Conclusion For the graphic quality party players who like to watch a thrilling gang story, the remake of Brothers of the Seas is a rare masterpiece in this generation. For players who love fast-paced shooting games or want to experience fresh gameplay, the remastered gameplay is still too old-fashioned. But I have to say that the Mafia series itself is a very attractive theme, and this work tells a story about loyalty, friendship, betrayal, love, and family through the rise and fall of a Mafia member in the organization. People are embarrassed, and it is also thought-provoking. I don't know if this trilogy remake means the complete end of this series, but I still hope that there will be a brand new Mafia story with the top pictures of the next era and the innovative gameplay that closely follows the era.

{"text" : "Looking ahead, I will say that in games most of all I do not like two moments: 1) when you do not understand what is happening around and what, in general, needs to be done. Where to go next. 2) when after passing the game there are a lot of questions and nothing is clear at all. This game has all two points. I will also say that this is the first game, after passing which I went to the manuals to read the explanation of the plot (fortunately, there is a sensible manual) P.s hidden PR of the leadership, I was paid. (no) For about the first 2-3 hours I wanted to score on this game. The moments when you don't understand where to run were too scared me away. You climb out of the hut, in the field, at night, around - nothing. And you run around the entire perimeter in the hope that you will find at least something. Probably strange, but here I am for linearity. Also great in the game are flashbacks. They look very cool and the transitions are simply divine. I would like to see this more often in other games. I really liked the setting of the second part. I really liked the setting of the first part. All these religious fanatics are an extremely interesting topic. BUT! The gameplay seemed a little boring to me. Yes, there is drive, there are scrimmers, there is fear. But ... in the first part it was implemented somehow better. I still remember that moment with the library from the 1st part. I remember that person in a wheelchair. I remember that fool who stood and visited his pistrun on the mountain of corpses. All this was stored in my memory. Immediately I went through and ... and forgot. I can't even remember the moment when I really crap. I still don’t understand why to shoot everything that you see. And then you also need to revise in order to hear the comment of the GG. It's strange. There is one very comical moment: then - spoiler =====> One of the few games when the ending just pulls out of the shit after itself. I almost gave up, but I found the strength and did not regret that I bought and passed. Good, comrades! 8.5 / 10 "}

The best part is it's all free.  This is why there is no Half-Life 3 or Left 4 Dead 3 or Portal 3, its because Valve is working on a sequel to this.

{"text" : "Oh boy, now that's a game I have really mixed feelings on... I will give only the down sides of the game so you know what you are getting yourself into and can decide for yourself if its worth your time. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, people are toxic. Whats even worse, is that you yourself can get toxic at times because of the others around you. From my experience this phenomenon isn't as bad as it used to be back in 2017 for example, since many of the then toxic people were kids, that are all grown up now and know how to act, so you will meet plenty more friendly people than before, but you will stilll have your fair share of stubborn (to say the least) people, especially at lower ranks where they haven't really come to terms with the game. After a while the game can get really repetitive and boring, even annoying for some. That I haven't experienced myself, but many of my friends have. I happen to really like the style of the game - you may do the same thing over and over, but you not only do it with many different people, which can significantly impact your experience with the game, but you also slowly but surely improve, which really motivates me to continue playing. What happens to some people though is that they either get bored of the game, which is completely understandable, or simply stop playing it out of frustration that they don't seem to improve and climb up the ranks. To that i would say keep playing - I myself was stuck in Silver Elite way beyond the 1000 hours of playtime that I had. If you plan on playing free to play - please go get your head checked. I myself decided to see for myself how it was going down in the non prime zone of the game. Let me tell you, you don't want to be down there. Of all the games I played, they were constantly flooded with not just your casual cheaters who trie at least to hide it, but the straight up helicopters that are the spinbotters. I would estimate that out of all the people who play non prime, at least 35 - 50% are cheating, and something like 30% are smurfing*. That's not really a great place for new players to start exploring the endless world of Counter Strike. Those are pretty much the main complaints I myself and friends of mine have had over the years when playing Counter Strike. Overall I really can't recommend against the game - it can be pretty much either really enjoyable and fun to play all the time, or the stupidest and most annoying game ever. That really depends on the mentality with which you play. I am no stranger to that honestly - I think that most players who have played for a while have had a period or two of ''Im never playing this stupid game again". but after some time you start missing playing it, and somehow you find yourself grinding it with the same passion you did before. That's really why I recommend it - any game that sticks with you so much, that you keep going back to it over and over again is worth paying money for. *For those of you who are unfamiliar with the term ''smurfing'' - that is an experienced player purposely playing at way lower ranks just to get matched with people way worse than them. What happens is that they get destroyed, and the smurf continues to boost their superiority complex. "}

{"text" : "The start of Alchemist's Awaking was rough. I didn't really know what I was doing. Yes, I knew it was a build and survive game, but it wasn't completely clear exactly how I'd be doing that. The tutorial is quite bare bones, and really doesn't do a great job of showing off what the game has to offer. If you can get past this tough start, you'll discover some quite unique elements which come together quite nicely so it's definitely worth sticking with.  The world looks pretty great, and you could spend a good amount of time just exploring and seeing what type of environments generate. The crafting system is deceptively deep. Everything comes from 9 base elements. This makes collecting what you need relatively simple, and also greatly lowers the hassle of inventory management.  The addition of magic is done well, and really gives making things a boost. Animating golems and having them do your bidding, flying around the world, throwing fireballs at enemies, and any other magic you discover works brilliantly and feels very fitting in the world.  The developer is very attentive and active in fixing bugs that occurring and providing updates. The game is relatively new still, but I believe this bodes well for the future health of the game. The development path seems realistic and achievable, so hopefully there is a lot more to come. The good looking world, unique inventory and crafting system, and integration of magic make up for the slack of a decent tutorial, slightly clunky combat and questionable AI. The crafting can seem complicated, but you can keep it simple at first and move on to more advanced techniques as you get to grips with the game. Alchemist's Awakening should not be written off as "yet another Minecraft clone". It definitely brings something new to the table, and is it continues in the same direction this could be the best title in this ever-expanding genre. If you're looking for an open-world crafting & survival game, there aren't many better options - even with AA being in such an early state. "}

A wide variety of different biomes, a lot of different decor items and a convenient block placement system (in fact, you just draw with blocks, which is convenient during construction) make the game interesting. But in view of the fact that this is a beta, there is a great lack of any realties of events, special dungeons, quests and bosses with NPCs, so the game becomes boring over time. But soon there should be a winter update that should add many new quests, items and biomes and greatly diversify the game. The game has a lot of potential. p.s.

{"text" : "Skyrim. How many memories and unforgettable moments are included in this word. Bethesda Game Studios' masterpiece was the best game of 2011 and, in my opinion, the best in the Elder Scrolls series. This game is mesmerizing, addictive with its atmosphere and you always want to return to Tamriel again and again .. if not immediately, then after a while. When I create a new character, I start everything in the same way as I always go through quests, it’s like I’m playing for the first time, plunging into ENT, and it’s not a bit boring. By the way, you can explore space if a giant hits you. And you can also surprise the guards (and not only them) with the power of your voice, put a cauldron on NPCs and steal things from under their noses, steal a sweet roll and much more ... Do not forget to drop by Sheogorath. Let's start with the main part of the game without DLC. Skyrim is replete with a large number of quests. The main branch is well developed, it is interesting to go through it, starting with the escape from Helgen and ending with the murder of the world eater - the dragon Alduin. Almost every NPC can give you a task - here's a huge side quest line. Sometimes boring, like: bring this, kill that, steal that, etc. Daedra factions and princes will also keep you busy. Conversations with NPCs worked out. You can talk with them on various topics, they talk about Skyrim, its history and their life. There are a lot of NPCs in this game, cities and locations seem to be alive. Books with the history of Skyrim, magic, Aedra, Daedra, dragonborn, gray-bearded, unusual architecture and nature, quests, everyday life of that time - all this somehow perfectly combines and gives Skyrim uniqueness and an extraordinary atmosphere that you will not find in other games. Great graphics, one of the most beautiful games of 2011. If you want beautiful games, then even now Skyrim is such a game. Plus, there's a special edition with improved graphics, so it's okay. The world is well developed and detailed, with the exception of nature (identical trees, stones, grass, etc.) and mountains (just textures). There is a free DLC for Skyrim with textures, honestly, I didn't see much difference. You can also put mods on improved graphics. The game has a character pumping by levels. Getting the next level, pumping skills, you get a skill point, which you can spend in the skill tree (if you have pumped it enough). There are branches for pumping vampires and werewolves. In Skyrim, by the way, there is blacksmithing, which allows you to create armor and weapons, which, in addition to manufactured ones, are unthinkable in the game. Lots of unique items. Keys, books, food, potions, scrolls, all kinds of ingredients for potion making - in general, there is a lot in the game. Locations in Skyrim are at every turn, that's the truth. And they are all very elaborate. In the city alone, you can go to 15-20 houses, if not more. Skyrim is huge, it will take about 20 minutes to run across it. There are many caves and dungeons. In the game, you can buy houses by becoming a tan in the Jarl's domain, or with the Hearthfire DLC you can buy a plot and build your own house with a choice of rooms (3 rooms and 3 houses). Two official add-ons for the game that could be bought. The third, Hearthfire, I described above. In the first, the cultists of Mirak, another dragonborn, want to kill you. You go to the island of Solstheim to give him lula and prove that you are the coolest dragonborn. In the second, you have a choice - to become a guardian of the light or to join the vampires. These are two factions that want to destroy each other. If you are a vampire, you can pump him. The game does not stand still, and people even now are engaged in this game and create mods for it: for quests, graphics, weapons and armor, NPCs, races, etc. In general, there are quite a few of them and they will definitely please you. In conclusion, I want to say that I strongly (yes, yes) recommend that you play this game at least once. I'm sure it will become your favorite game, as it happened to me. I do not regret my 200 hours on licenses and over 1000 hours on pirates. I do not regret the nerves while climbing High Hrothgar, pumping a vampire and a werewolf, trying to marry Eila and removing helmets from the guards. 10 Stolen Sweet Rolls, Shot Through Knees, and 10 Talos Worships "}

{"text" : "... The game is excellent, you can build even a flying penis, even your favorite robot from a movie / cartoon, donate is almost non-existent, in the same WOT donate has more impact on POWER than here. Pros: -hardcore (if your tank manage to take one shot, it's his own fault, redo it). -More time is devoted to the construction of the robot than to the battles, you constantly finish something, redo something (Linux users will like it, the bazaar). - almost complete absence of donation. -permanent buns from developers, like codes for a couple of days of premium, spare parts, etc. Cons: -the audience, she is here from minecraft and the world of tanks, which means that even if you manage to build a wunderwaffe, your team may be: a moron who built a dick on wheels, he does not shoot, but shows the phallic power of the owner; a nogebator who built a boat and did not even test it, and most of the battle his boat will be turned over; a berserker who is just trying to BREAK your tank on the battlefield, or even try to turn it over. -a slightly strange system of ship levels, for example, you can build a ship from the blocks of the first level, but hang a level 5 cannon on it, while the ship will be of the second level, and it will be possible to play only on servers of the second level, i.e. one-shot newcomers.

{"text" : "Hard platformer Very detailed, believable World - interaction with AI characters in the game - ambient soundtrack Sometimes super frustrating - you have to try some passages over and over again Game is always 640x480, which may cause problems with modern systems.  Use DXWnd to play game in windowed mode. Don't bother with ddraw hacks. Make sure AbeWin.exe does not have reduced color mode checked in compatibility tab (otherwise colors will be wrong) This game is pretty unique. Though it uses game mechanics that had been there for a while - such as the “trial and error - jump'n'puzzle” game, however, it adds a unique world with fascinating creatures and new gameplay elements like communication. The puzzles take some time to solve - and the game requires you to have good timing skills to perform the actions. Abe's Oddysee can get frustrating as you need to try some running and jumping parts over and over again to get to the goal. But it is also quite fun and satisfying once you solve puzzles.  In overall a very good game and the prerendered 2D graphics look good even today. The ambient soundtrack is a plus to the atmosphere of Oddworld. "}

This is for me the early access game of the year and next year it could be the game of the year. A massive world with many villages, bunkers and places to explore. Animals and npc's who give this world a realistic touch of a working ecologically system - eat or you got eaten. A very realistic simulation of the human body and what he needs to work.  This is a game for people who want to decide who they like to survive on the island. You can play focussed on stealth elements by hiding or leaving a conflict, playing aggressive and try to kill everything and if you play with other players in multiplayer you can use tactics to stay alive and or get more and more better loot. Scum is actually a very great game and I'm hopeful onf the future features! "}
{"text" : "The game, which gives us a positive impression from the very beginning with its promise of a different side of the war, becomes even more admirable as you dive into it. When you first start the game, we find ourselves with different characters in a dilapidated building. Each of these characters has their own characteristics, while some are experts in using weapons, others can run for a long time or carry more items with them. In the game, like all survival games, we need to loot to survive. We perform these looting at night in the game. For example, while you are exploring with one of your characters, you can leave one character as a guard, and put the other to rest to rest. The character we bought to loot outside gets tired when he returns, and it turns out to be a logical choice to leave it at home the next night to rest. Our characters always have a full stomach and keeping a lot of back plays an important role. If you feed the raw meats you collect outside without cooking, our characters may not like them. But just like every survival game, things do not go so easily in This War of Mine. For example, in a house where we go for looting, we may encounter people in worse condition than us and we can return without touching their belongings with pity. The effect of the characters in the game on the player is very well prepared. He successfully explains that survival does not just end with looting, but sometimes leaves us alone with difficult choices. Not only do we deal with dangerous people in the game, but hunger, disease, and the continuing war are a major threat to us in the army. For example, when going to loot a building at night, we can return empty-handed because of the soldiers there. And even when we come back, our friends may be massacred and all our supplies stolen. Every action you take in the game leaves you with your own conscience. After playing the game for a long time, maybe it starts to get cold as it really is, and regardless of anyone's eyes, only the cold and dark side of War slams your face every time you play. Of course, there is also a craft system in the game. We can make many tools with the items we collect from the ruins. We can prepare tables, chairs, beds, household items, radios to entertain us, or weapons that we can use outside at home. For example, when going out to loot, it is useful to always have a lock pick to open a lock and a shovel to quickly pass the piles that will come before us. We need workstations that we need to use in the game to make crafting, it is possible to do them with the tools and equipment we collect from the environment. When we go to a region in the game, the whole region is not visible. Only areas that are at eye level of our character are open. But before we enter a room, we can look through the keyhole and see what or who is in the room. Also, sounds coming from the environment can appear around in the form of sound waves. For example, the fact that the things you think of human footsteps when you are downstairs come from a mouse when you go upstairs makes you incredibly comfortable. It is admirable that the game successfully delivered this tension. As for the combat mechanics in the game, we usually continue with the hide and kill system that we are familiar with Stealth / Action games. When we encounter more than one enemy, waiting for them to get away from each other and hunting one by one in silence is the most logical and easy solution. Although This War of Mine does not work wonders in technical matters, it manages to successfully present the atmosphere it reflects to us. The game, which we can define as 2.5D, completes the dark atmosphere with the method the producers call Pencil Effect. I can say that I really like this effect, which makes the background look like it was drawn with a pencil. The music, on the other hand, is prepared emotionally enough to make us feel the atmosphere. It fully reflects the feeling of helplessness. The sounds are sufficient for this type of game. It is clear from every aspect that the dialogues of the characters we encounter are being worked on a lot. This War of Mine will please players who are familiar with the genre in general. As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, both emotional and tension-filled moments are waiting for us with the fact that he presents us behind the war. "}

{"text" : "Hello guys. I haven't made a comment text in a while, so let's try to resume the practice. Holodrive is a multiplayer 2D platform shooting game. I met him at the time of the rise of games on Facebook. At that time, if I'm not mistaken, the game could only be played there. Logically, he had a very active audience for a new project and it was the moment that I most enjoyed the game. I had other rounds and turns, until he was playing this last Sunday, April 9, 2019. There have been significant changes since the time of Face until its current version on Steam. It is a very casual game, currently there is a level progression with cosmetics and equipment, but they cannot be enough to motivate the exploration of the game. Its casual aspect is very strong, so it is interesting to be played with friends in games not so long, but that can be repeated with some frequency. The game is well done, although simple. It has its own Discord to encourage community interaction and it is a Brazilian development. As I said, it has quality, so even if it is not for a long investment of hours, it is worth you to go there, test the game and have some fun with your friends. Let's give it that strength, the game deserves it. "}
{"text" : "I really don't want to give this game a thumbs down! It's more like a neutral (+) review. If you like planet coaster or zoos, you will probably like this game too! A dream for patient builders, but with many technical issues. It's very fun but feels like a beta. It has a lot of bugs, performance issues and a fast game speed. So, should you buy it? Finally! I've waited too long for this game! Zoo Tycoon was one of my first PC games. It's very nostalgic for me. I've played it as a little girl for hours! It's awesome to see a proper modern zoo game. Though I'm still a bit disappointed. Pros: 1. Good graphics, realistic animal animations, great rain and snow effects. 2. Very relaxing and immersive zoo experience. You really feel like you're in a zoo. 3. More than 50 detailed, lovely, cute and different animals. Very fun to watch! 4. Lovely details, 7 different biomes, climate does matter, a lot place to build. 5. A dream for builders. Creative and free ways to build, blueprints, workshop,... 6. 4 different game modes; career, sandbox, franchise and challenge mode. 7. A very, very good sound. The music and animal sounds are incredible. 8. You can learn more about the animals if you want to. (real life and ingame) Neutral: 1. The management is better than in Planet coaster, but still not that great/important. 2. You can visit other zoos but it would be much better if there would be more features. 3. The career is ok,  but nothing special. It's like a tutorial but it's not a good one. Cons: 1. Horrible performance! It's not as worse as in planet coaster but still disappointing. 2. Many, many bugs! I luckily didn't have any long term game breaking bugs yet! Please fix! 3. The game is too fast! 3 seconds are 1 day. Make it customizable! 4. The controls are bad/complex. 5. No petting zoo, underwater animals, birds, etc. A bunch of popular animals are missing. 6. I'm like 100% sure that there will be many, many expensive DLC's. 7. No mod support. Conclusion: Well, I already said what I like and what I don't like. It's a very fun, relaxing and realistic game. You really feel immersed, but sadly the game feels like a beta. It has a lot of bugs and a poor performance. I'm pretty sure that I will play this game for a very long time. It's a dream for patient people who love to decorate and build! They should have delayed the release, but I hope that they will fix the performance and bugs in future! Should you buy it? Well, if you are a zoo or planet coaster fan and like building and decorating you should consider buying it. But you should keep in mind that it still has a lot of bugs (game breaking too), a bad performance and a few other negative points. If you don't care about them buy it. If you should, you should wait for a few patches or/and a sale or just skip the game. I will update this review after an upcoming (big) DLC/Patch! Still questions? Feel free to write a comment or send me a message. Thanks for reading and happy gaming! "}

How scared I was at that moment but could not tear myself away from the power of fire, how But it was cool In general, this story was somewhere in 2013, well, 4 years have passed and in 2017 I started to play it, studied the world, turned on cheats, pissing spiders, killing skeletons, killing giants with a sword, even though they took me out with just 1 blow. it was on a pirate, on my face I didn't get the same sensations as on a pirate. Because this world of Skyrim was already familiar. I went through a few quests and forgot. In Skyrim you could be a thief, you could be a great warrior, you could be a murderer. many things that cannot be described.

{"text" : "is a digital adaptation of the popular hidden-movement board game where you play as Dracula or one of the Hunters. If you choose to play as Dracula, you will need to gain 13 influence points in order to win the game, while escaping from the Hunters. As Dracula, you can only move one step at a time and and can only perform an action at night time. You will be able to use cards to help you, such as calling on minions to fight or items to delay or to block the Hunters. As a Hunter, your goal is to kill Dracula before he reaches the requisite influence points. You can move on land with a carriage or over water with a boat. You can also move faster with a train, but this require tickets. Hunters have multiple turns in a day, and each turn you can move, take a card from the supply, rest, etc. Fights will take place using cards if you encounter Dracula. The game does have a good tutorial, but playing by trial and error is also reasonable. It's fine if you want to try the game out first and then look up details after in the tutorial. That way you can just focus on the things that were not so obvious. You can play with other people or you can play with or against the AI. The game sessions can be a bit lengthy and so be aware of that. You can spend easily more than an hour per game. The animations on the cards are fantastic. The graphics on the map and the figures are okay, though not as good. The music's mood fits the theme of the game well. The game can be fully played with a mouse. For a board game, it's in keeping with some others. You can definitely get a lot of hours out of it.  is a board game adaptation that involves two asymmetric sides competing, though I did find that playing as Dracula was quite boring. I prefer to play as a Hunter. I do think that this game would be better suited and more fun with friends instead of with/against AI. It will take some time to play. Each session can easily last more than an hour, so you will need to be prepared for that. I enjoyed my time, but the sessions are a bit too long for me. Overall I would rate it 6.5/10. "}

For the declared price of 129 rubles, in principle, it is normal, but not everyone wants to spend money on such a game.

{"text" : "I entered the death version before, but at that time I was not used to the slow action of the characters and dropped frames. I abandoned it shortly after playing. The remastered version has 70 hours of four-eye platinum pass for a long time to make up for the feeling. The Dark Souls remake left me the deepest impression on the map design, and Dark Souls 3 is also beyond reach. The Fire Passing Sacrifice is almost connected to all the scenes in the game. It can be said to extend in all directions. The game's grand world view and exciting BOSS The battle is also very attractive to me, but what fascinates me most is the bit by bit strategy in the complex map, to see through the maliciousness of the old thief, and finally the sense of accomplishment at the moment of "willing dark flowers" is no less than defeating the BOSS. I feel that some of the shortcomings are that the design of the BOSS in Soul One is not reasonable. Some BOSSs are low in difficulty and slower (may also be related to the slowness and strict load-bearing requirements of Soul One characters), such as the gluttonous dragon and the steel giant puppet; But some bosses are very face-conscious, such as King City Shuangji and the Four Kings of Xiaolongde. The remastered version is mainly to complement the world view of the black soul. In the first generation, there are Gwen, Nit, Witch, Onstein and Artreus who have obtained the king soul, there are the black forest courtyard and the demon ruins, the magic kingdom Ula Xilu and Anorrond, where the gods are still alive... I don’t think the difference is very big on the screen, the texture improvement is not obvious on the screen, but the special effects (flame, fog door, spell, spell, miracle props, etc.) Done. I think the biggest change in the senses is that 60 frames have been unlocked (the original version can also be unlocked through a patch). In addition, the remastered version changed some settings to make the game more reasonable, such as the ability to use props in batches, adding a bonfire next to the catacombs skeleton blacksmith, etc. Even though it is already platinum, sometimes the files previously saved in front of the BOSS room are picked up It’s cool to change the routine and play it again... I can’t make up anymore, the old thief’s new work is GKD!!! "}

{"text" : "Lurk in the Dark Prologue is a Kickstarter demo made by one person, and soon we will be getting the first full episode –  . The Prologue sets up the start of the first episode with Marcus going to a crime scene to investigate a murder. Once there, things quickly turn array when the ghosts of his past begin to haunt him. Is this all in his head, a figment of his imagination? Is any of this even real?  There isn’t much to go on in the prologue, with bits and pieces scattered throughout the level and the ending cinematic, shedding some light on where we can expect the story to go in the full game. Also, the English is broken in certain places, like the subtitles and notes. It isn’t awful but will be noticeable at times. The gameplay in the demo isn’t complex, it's mainly a walking simulator in a horror setting. One thing that did pique my interest was the menu labeled – weapons, so we may see some form of combat in the full game. This is always a plus, as walking simulators often feel lackluster in this department in comparison to horror games where you can engage enemies in combat.  The sad thing is there is so little of this game to play, with only one puzzle to solve. The puzzle was decent and could be an indicator of the quality of puzzles in the full game. The right mouse button is used for “detective vision”, highlighting points of interest and objects you can interact with. Using items on specific objects requires you to open your inventory and select the item, feeling outdated and slow. I hope we see a more Resident Evil kind of interaction, with a menu where you see all your items pop up and you use the one you think fits the puzzle.  That claustrophobic feeling is perfectly captured here, going down those tight hallways with the ominous music playing and the only sound you hear, coming from your footsteps, creating a great tension-filled atmosphere. This game uses the Unity engine and pushes it, with the graphics being amazing, and great attention to detail. The monster design was underwhelming and I look forward to something better in the full release. The interior of the mansion you visit is also rich in detail, with no low texture eyesores all over the place. Lighting also deserves massive praise, it isn’t too dark, robing the player of the immense detail the rooms have. It strikes the perfect balance by creating a scary atmosphere that builds up tension and letting the player see the amazing work this man has done with the textures and models in the game.  The ambient sounds, SFX, and music all deserve praise for creating a frightening atmosphere at times, with the player praying for the jump scare to happen already, so it doesn’t tease you anymore, but alas, that sweet relief never comes when you want it, does it?  It’s amazing what this short demo was able to accomplish, making some full AAA horror games look poor in comparison, and it manages to recreate that same feeling I had when I first saw P.T. The atmosphere is filled with tension from the very first minute, the music and ambient sound compliment it perfectly, with the graphics looking great. It does have its problems, with the clunky UI, broken English translation, weird stiff movement, and underwhelming monster design, but given that it is free, there is no reason not to give it a test run at least, and be the judge yourself.

{"text" : "Tomb Raider (2013) is one of the best adventures-survival horrors but also action that have been released with great graphics, which are combined with the appropriate sound investment. Every time Lara has to face a riddle or is in a difficult position, the indignation she feels as well as her curiosity but also her admiration and surprise for everything she discovers is captured in a brilliant and realistic way. I also liked that unlike previous series like Legend where the Action element dominates, this game largely involves a lot of exploration something we had seen in previous titles and returns to the 2013 title but the Action element does not disappear but exists and peaks from the middle and as we move towards the end. It is characteristic that on the one hand there are tombs and various objects that need enough exploration to be discovered on the other hand there is also Action which sometimes makes the player quite difficult even in Easy. In other words, we are talking about a title that combines Adventure and Action. What I did not like was that the exploration was largely optional which meant that the player could complete the story relatively quickly as well as its relatively short duration compared to previous titles. Overall I think it is one of the best tomb raiders ever released and if exploration was a prerequisite for the finish, it would probably be the best of the series. "}
{"text" : "Full motion video, love simulation, multiple choices and multiple endings. The protagonist is Vinny, who is 1.75 meters tall and comes from London. An ordinary 27-year-old single young man. Due to the new crown epidemic, the city is blocked and people can only stay At home, out of boredom, he focused his eyes on a dating app on his phone. By using this app, he will be able to communicate emotionally with the girls through video dating without going out, then it is up to you to decide whether he can successfully capture the hearts of the girls. 1. "Five Dates" is a romantic comedy game played by real people, published by Wales Interactive. I don't need to say how well the studio is known, such as "Bunker", "Incarnation Detective" and "Reverse". Excellent moving image works are also produced by him. 2. At the beginning of the game, the player needs to customize the protagonist from four aspects. The first is the cover image. There are 5 types to choose from. It is similar to an avatar and will affect the girl's first impression of you. The second is the work industry. There are also 5 types to choose from. It means that the industry field you are in will affect the basic estimate of your sister. Then there are interests and hobbies. There are 10 kinds of hobbies. You need to choose three of them. It indicates your knowledge reserve and will affect the topic content in the process of talking with you. Finally, there are constellations that you love to see. It is very mysterious. It affects all aspects of your life subconsciously, such as daily habits, etc., and also affects the tacit understanding between your sister and you. 3. After completing the personal registration, you can match the girls and officially start dating. The title of this game is Five Dates, which correspond to five girls, namely Maya, Grace, Safran, Shana and Peggy. They have distinct personalities and need different methods to conduct strategies. They want to know their own in the game. The progress of the strategy can be checked at any time by pressing the S key. 4. The specific gameplay is very simple. Players only need to see with their eyes. Except for some different choices during the specified time, the whole process is as easy as watching a drama. After all, at the blind date, no one knows whether the two parties will say something wrong, whether they will suddenly be cold, and what super awkward things will happen next, etc. Can it not arouse the curiosity of the players. 5. When an ending is reached, the player will return to the origin, re-customize the character information, and continue the second week of dating experience. Don't worry about wasting time, the game provides a function to skip repeated segments, just press the Tab key. 6. This work was completed by the director of "Complex". The whole process was more than 7 hours of continuous shooting. It contains 10 different endings. Although there are not many scenes involved, the volume of works of the same type is not small. From the time it took me to record one of the endings, it may not be too exaggerated to say that it is the longest full-motion video. + The actor's face value and acting skills are online throughout the whole process, a strong sense of substitution + high-quality localization, humorous, very funny + relaxed blind date experience, basically no operation is required-the script is relatively general, and some options are somewhat far-fetched. For the price of a movie ticket, you can socialize with five girls. What are you waiting for? "}

{"text" : "Here comes, finally comes, the evil simulator developers finally set their sights on the submarine, and it is such a submarine simulator that simulates the real submarine environment. The player plays as a submarine commander during World War II, and obtains materials to arm his submarine by completing different tasks. How to survive the battle and bring his crew home is the main issue you need to consider. The game has two perspectives to choose from, first-person and side-view. First-person can walk freely in the submarine, experience the real submarine environment, various dashboards, machines, small submarine, compact but detailed overall planning, various real The details all make people feel as if they are really working in a submarine. From the side view, you can view the side view of the submarine, and you can see the status and work of the employees in each cabin. With a wide field of vision, you can more easily adjust the distribution of people in the submarine and observe problems when encountering enemies. As a simulator, this game can be said to be very hard-core. The entire submarine operation is extremely complicated. Supplementing oxygen, cooking and rest, submarine maintenance, etc. require the player to personally operate, let alone observe the enemy during battle, operate torpedoes, etc. It must be considered in every detail, otherwise the crew will die. It can be said that the difficulty of starting is not low, and it needs a little familiarity with the overall content and process to truly master the operation and play of the game. The game's combat settings are excellent, with a comprehensive range of weapons and excellent shooting feel. It can be said that it can truly experience the combat scene of a World War II submarine. After successfully defeating the enemy, you can also salvage the enemy’s materials and clean up the battlefield, but unfortunately, the post-war recovery gives people a perfunctory feeling. The detailed details in the front simulate the real situation and the recovery after the war. Part of it can be recycled with one click, allowing people to escape in minutes. Hardcore, this is my first experience after playing. As a submarine simulator, this game really shows the players all the things that the submarine needs to control. At the same time as novelty, it is also difficult to get started. The problem, for some impatient players, it is easy to cause a dismissal effect. After that, there was also a big problem with the setting of AI. I was fighting with the enemy in full swing, and you little sailors gave me a nest in the barn to sleep. Even if I didn’t assign tasks to you, shouldn’t you stick to your post to fight? Is the battle over? I really went to work on time and got off work on time. My boat sank. How can you survive? There is no tension at all. Fighting! The picture of the game is still relatively real. Many details of the submarine are well described, including some small settings that are convenient for players to play. They are also very considerate. For example, the side view will hide some machines that block the view, and only when they leave the cabin. Will be displayed again. However, the overall ui needs to be improved. It is too simple and scattered. Several items that need to be observed are in different positions. It is very tiring to play. You have to go to a special location to see and want Arrived. The current optimization of the game can be said to be very bad, very unfriendly to players with lower configurations. Moreover, there are many bugs in the game, many of which will affect the normal playing experience. I hope that the developers will update and improve in the future. The theme of submarine simulation can be said to be very novel, and it can be said to be authentic in terms of the degree of restoration, but too hard-core operations, too many bugs and poor optimization undoubtedly have a great impact on the game play , For hardcore players is undoubtedly a gluttonous feast, but for some light players, it is enough to persuade the issue, please consider carefully before buying. +Hardcore real operating system +Original submarine structure and graphics +Real battle scenes and life scenes +Excellent Jianzhong -Poor optimization -Too many bugs -UI needs to be improved Submarine enthusiasts "}

{"text" : "Wargroove is a nice game. Not for everyone, but a good game. For those who loved the Advance Wars saga, they certainly cannot say they are not happy with a LOT of CONTENT that this game has for the huge price of 16 euros. I was certainly expecting a higher price for a lot of content. There is the challenge - the campaign - the puzzle, all enclosed by the mechanics of collecting the stars that will unlock sketches of drawings and also that entertains the player to overcome the maps in the 4 levels of difficulty. So what are the differences between Advace wars and this one? in Advance wars obviously the scenario is modern, and maybe in some ways it may like more. You can group the units into one while here it is impossible, but the striking thing is the fact that Wargroove is handled well even if the grouping of the units there is for example the possibility of super powers, called GROOVE that the commanders of the units can use in case of need and believe me SOMETIMES THEY TURN THE SITUATION TOTALLY. In terms of the campaign, the campaign itself is not difficult, because during development they released a patch that balanced the game otherwise there were NO SAVES DURING THE MISSION AND THE GAME WAS HARDCORE. There was no escape and some missions NOW AS NOW are still DIFFICULT. So you have fun playing it several times until you pass it. The difficulty level changes the fact that you get more or less stars. Units are really well built due to the fact that EFFICACY AND VULNERABILITY change the course of the game, sometimes causing a map to be lost or won. THEN ALSO THE MULTIPLYER THEN THE MAP EDITOR WITH SHARING INSIDE THEIR SERVER, NOT WORKSHOP - maybe a shame, but still done well. what are you waiting to get it ??? : D "}

{"text" : "Rocket League is a good game with friends, It may take a few hours of playing to figure out even the basic things, but once you master moving and hitting each match will help you improve and develop them, It will take maybe a little time to get used to the balloon being over you, but give it a try and figure out how your car will face the road, over time this should become a second nature Reversing forward and using boost will also take some time to learn effectively but this is one of the easiest and most useful early game skills besides hitting the ball and jump. As you progress you can learn to predict bounces from walls or corners, do a double jump, and learn how to hit the ball in the sky You don't have to spend real money on the game , but if you do, I would recommend buying the Rocket Pass, as you will earn an item every time you level up and speed up your earning, If you earn keys throughout the Pass, you can buy the next one for free with the keys you got in the last one, You can also open crates that you win with keys, which I don't, but some people love it. People are generally very willing to trade and swap crates so you will always have this option Overall fairly easy to learn but hard to master. Fun to play with friends. Fast-paced action in most games Despite having some pretty toxic players like most multiplayer games, you will meet some cool people who make the game quite fun even if you lose. "}

Of course, I kicked, tried to prove that a rational being, I think means I exist, insisted on egocentrism and exhibitionism, and drying up such nonsense.

Things ive noticed in the game (that will most likely be fixed in the future) *Written 2/27 - Gun weapons have a cooldown time (on the basic attack) while melee does not. (fix) - Items in the only starting zone are expensive (now it may be balanced late game, but if you are going to add this in the v1.0.0 build, with only 1 zone to practice, i'd suggest letting them be easily accessable early, why? to balance and let people test what may or may not be broken OP) - only enemies are spiders in 1.0.0 (now there will be more in the future, but if you buy it as of right now, that is the only enemy type you will encounter - You can jump! - Great graphics and unique maps - Gameplay runs smooth, and for the most part at a solid 60+ fps - Inside vision of the dungeons before you actually enter, which is pretty cool. Now overall, this game looks very interesting, it is in VERY EARLY ACCESS so keep that in mind. So should you buy it? Its hard to say right now but with the road map that has been included, at least we know they are working hard on it.

{"text" : "Have you played the previous ones and enjoyed them? So you will definitely enjoy this tbm. Pros: - Gameplay: for me it's the strongest point of the game. It's really excellent. - Visual and ambience: they are very good, characteristic of the series, of course with more places to explore. - Speaking of exploration: you pass by several planets and other points of the galaxy on board your ship. Each one very different, with different environments and enemies. - Loots everywhere, as always. Who doesn't enjoy opening some chests? ^^ - Arsenal is vast enough. - Very cool classes with varied builds. - Soundtrack is another strong point. They excite and thrill. - Chaos mode! Much bigger challenge, with perks that change the whole game! Conferring advantages and disadvantages. - The 3 campaign DLCs so far have been very good. Highlighting Bounty of Blood. - Main campaign: it has its cool moments, among them reviewing old acquaintances of the franchise. But ... Cons: - .., antagonists are very boring. The best is when we are done with them. (There are plenty of reasons). - Some annoying subtitle bugs and occasional rendering delays, but nothing that gets in the way. Overall, great game. Looking forward to the next DLC's. 9.0 / 10 "}

{"text" : "I was really impressed with this game. The is fluid and is a lot of fun. The developer used, a concept that is, the game is for all types of players, from casual to competitive players. The mechanics are in style, they are performed in trio, but the similarity ends there. Although automatic combos are accessible, there is a lot to manage during combat. Three-on-three fights raise the level of complexity, as characters can attack together, and switching allows you to replenish energy, which determines the type of attack you can perform. There are blows that use 1 (one) or more bars of energy, the more bars are spent, the stronger the attack will be, and of course there is the possibility of combining the blows of the characters, to perform an insane combo. Each character has a different fighting profile, Goku, for example, is a character with balanced attributes, ideal for those just starting out. The game still has a story mode,, and of course casual (ranked) matches. In the general context, it is an excellent, fun game, finally a competitive game. In my view, it is the best game since the late one, in my case I played that game on the Nintendo Wii. Of course, in addition to all these qualities in, we still have the characters that were part of our childhood, that is who is a fan of, this game is a mandatory title. "}

Everything the ski resort owner can do, such as setting ticket prices, managing restaurants, and managing finances, is implemented while solidifying the slopes with a regular car and operating a gondola.

{"text" : "I'm gonna give this game a thumbs up because it's very fun and I see a lot of potential in it. But, as everyone says, damn, is full of hackers.  EDIT #1 : since the anti-cheat update there are fewer hackers... Easy anti-cheat is not the best anti-hack out there, but it's better than nothing) First of all, the devs should implement a report system because in this state a lot of people use hacks thinking they won't encounter any issues and that's not ok... The servers could get a little look up to also. And obviously, new game mods and workshop integration would make the game a lot greater, maybe a creative mode where the people can make they're own maps and put them up for others to enjoy. EDIT #2: The new season arrived, and it came with new maps, skins and a new "show"  (The gauntlet showdown) in which is no team based mini-games... Not much of a new game mode. Nothing really interesting tbh, I still wait for new game mods.. maybe next season :) If the game remains in this state I don't give it a long life imo, altrough it got a massive amount of interest from people both from steam and playstation.

The "while True: learn ()" itself is built on programming, which means this game will make your brains think and develop. What you need to know, the pros: + The owner has a cat + Regular training + Plot + Unusual and interesting style of the game + Russian interface (in fact, it is only needed) ---------- + Learning basic machine skills learning in a playful way + Sometimes the game tells you about real programming during the game, or gives you links to this information for you to read or watch + Really makes you think and solve puzzling over seemingly simple tasks Cons: - Will make her hate when it's hard - Tricky puzzles - If you play this game for a long time, you can go crazy - Makes you feel stupid - + - If someone in the family fumbles about this strange game (bullshit for programmers), then ask them to pass the game, or youtube to help you TOTAL: Well, you can play this, for programmers / for those who want to learn something new for themselves / for who just want to play / for those who want to kill their nerves. I repeat once again, not everyone will be able to complete this game to the end, this is not a child's game in which everything is easy, this game is a solid hemorrhoid.

{"text" : "Having only played the original old Deus Ex for a short bit, and remembering it like it was "just another fps game", i opened up Deus Ex: Human Revolution with low expectations. I was positively surprised to say the least. The story of the game is very well written, mixing in a lot of twists here and there, a lot of them clearly very inspired by real world conspiracy theories. Unlike most other games, even ones with well written stories, this game doesn't just offer you a linear path from point A to B, telling you a story a long the way. This game features optional side quests, rewards and more. You can choose a lot of different ways to complete everything as well. You can choose to go full Rambo mode and just rush in shooting everything, or you can go sneaky, even complete most of the game without "killing", by using close combat, gas grenades, stun and tranquilizer guns and more. What you choose will also have impact on how the game will continue offering several different endings and twists in the story a long the way. If i have to say something negative about this game there is a few things to mention. Using stealth to complete the game is hard, very very hard sometimes, which if you don't mind killing, will make you want to go for the easier way and just shoot your way through, be aware of your ammo though, as you will quickly run out and need to check every single corpse, room etc, to keep gathering ammo. Also choose yours "augs" wisely as some offer a lot of advantages over others. There is one very annoying thing about the game in my opinion, the controls could be better in certain areas. Like the game NOT having a option to switch between hold/toggle crouch, was annoying me like crazy in the beginning. I will highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a single player FPS game with a deep and well written story. Especially if you also are the type of person that likes conspiracy theories or is a critic of science. "}

{"text" : "In my review I will not say anything new, everyone already knows everything about GTA 5 THE PLOT: only because of him I gave a positive assessment of this game, this game has a wonderful plot, beautiful characters, a wonderful living world, in general, the plot has no questions , everything is fine there, I can't even say the minuses. But a completely different topic is ONLINE, it is pretty nasty, there are a lot of cheaters in sessions who throw off billions of you, and then they ban you, a lot of inadequate ones, bombing shkolots, who drives a kuruma and kills everything that moves. Also, a separate topic is online downloads, they are just incredibly long here. Out of my 308 hours, I spent 5 hours downloading, and there are also endless downloads when you freeze and you have to restart. About some kind of robbery-type missions where the team is important, you can even score if you have no friends who normally play this game, they always throw selected vegetables at your team. You can also talk about updates and online pricing policy. UPDATES - yes, they come out often and are added to the game for free, but we can assume that this is still all conditional, because everything they add in new updates costs a lot of money, and if you didn't wind up billions back in 2014, then you are nothing here you can't afford it) everything is very expensive. And then how to buy all this? That's right, donate, a card with $ 8 million costs about 2k-2.5k. If you donate, then congratulations, you can buy yourself 2 new cars out of 10 added and some regular farm hangar, where you will carry boxes for a penny for days, and then you go into the game and see that all the money has been withdrawn from you due to the fact that you got a cheater, or just like that. To pester. And the latest updates are all kind of monotonous and boring, they will add a couple of new vehicles, stuffed with all sorts of guns from all sides, slap the price of $ 5 million, add some next farm building and play. That's all I can say about playing online for 200+ hours. Now I play single player with mods, only this still saves the game - hundreds of different high-quality mods, models of real cars, additional missions, characters, etc. "}

{"text" : "Kung Fury may be the greatest thing I have ever seen. A gloriously absurd love letter to the 80s, and everything that decade had to offer - it is a Swedish short film which offers another clear example of what Kickstarter is capable of, when it is used by people with the passion and commitment to see their projects through to the end. In the crime-ridden 1980s, a young cop (David Sandburg) watches his partner brutally killed by a kung fu master. Before he can even attempt to take revenge, though, he is struck by lightning and bit by a cobra (just go with it). While this would obviously kill a normal person, this young man is far from normal - instead, this awakens something in him, and he immediately learns a form of kung fu so powerful that it is prophesised that only one person would ever be able to master it (seriously, just go with it). In that single moment, this young man becomes 'Kung Fury' - the best cop in the world. However, Kung Fury meets what may be the greatest challenge of his life in the form of a time travelling Adolf Hitler (Jorma Taccone), otherwise known as the Kung Führer, who travels forward in an attempt to kill him and become the greatest Kung Fu master in the world. In desperation, Kung Fury turns to Hackerman (Leopold Nilsson) - a hacker so skilled that he can hack through time to allow Kung Fury to travel back in time to kill Hitler before he has the chance to travel to the future. Unfortunately, Hackerman 'hacks too much time', and Kung Fury is sent back too far. Seemingly stuck in the Viking age, Kung Fury meets Barbarianna and Katana (Eleni Young and Helene Ahlson), Viking warrior-women who wield machine guns and ride dinosaurs (because, of course they do). He also meets the Norse god, Thor (Andreas Caling), who offers to transport him to Nazi Germany - where he can finally have his epic show-down with the Kung Führer. Kung Fury is a strange little film (just in case the brief over-view above didn't make that clear). The most absurd excesses of your typical 80s action film are really only the starting point, here - as you might expect from a film that includes kung fu, time travel, dinosaurs, machine-gun wielding Vikings, and Nazis. It is also a legitimately great looking film, too. Sure, it might all look cheesy as hell - but, it never actually looks cheap. It's pretty clear that a great deal of time and effort went into making the film look the way that it does. Pretty much everything other than the main cast, and a few props, is computer generated, here - giving the film an odd 'video-game' look which actually works very well in establishing the tone that the film-makers are ofter. One notable action sequence toward the end of the film is even deliberately staged to look like some sort of old-school action video game - showing us a foreground of Kung Fury fighting his way through a stream of Nazi soldiers, while more soldiers mill about aimlessly in the background. It can be difficult to judge the quality of acting that is clearly intended to be deliberately 'bad'. Obviously, the only standard that can really be applied, here, is how well the performances contribute to what they are trying to achieve. And, in that regard, it would have to be another clear success. I still have no idea whether any of these people can actually 'act' - but, at least in the making of Kung Fury, it obviously doesn't matter. Kung Fury himself, as played by David Sandburg (who also wrote and directed the film) is a hilarious caricature of the typical 80s action hero - all gruff voice and, occasionally, stilted line delivery. The rest of the cast are clearly aiming for the same level with their own performances. The original Kickstarter campaign included the promise of a full-length film among its stretch goals - though, they didn't quite reach that point. This must have been disappointing for everyone involved - yet, at the same time, I have to wonder if it might have been for the best. Kung Fury feels like a complete, and self-contained, project - something that was clearly intended from the very beginning to be a short film. And, it is fantastic. But, there is still the nagging thought that taking what they had and trying to turn it into a full-length film would have stretched the joke a bit too far. Still, given the quality of what is on offer here, I'm sure they could have found a way to make it work. Kung Fury is fantastic - I feel like I should reiterate that point. It's also completely absurd (I didn't even mention Triceracop, or the surprise cameo from David Hasslehoff). Honestly, the only situation where I can imagine someone not enjoying Kung Fury would be if you had a genuine aversion to this sort of deliberate 'so bad it's good' style of humor. In that case, sure, I can understand why you might not be interested. But, I still feel like you would be missing out. "}

{"text" : "If you've enjoyed games like Battlefield, Battlefront, Arma 3 or any tactical shooters with large amount of players, this is the game for you. For a F2P player, getting on the same level as paid players might take some time. Because of this, you need to spend your credits wisely and use trial (30 minutes trial of any weapon/vehicle upgrade of your choice) before making any purchases as they are not refundable. The size of battles are massive, playing with friends is a lot of fun. You can do a blitzkrieg rush with tanks, rain an entire platoon down from the skies like paratroopers (but hey who needs parachutes when you got scifi) and surprise capture bases. Whether you're a tactical nut or a casual FPS player, this game is worth trying out. It's richest I've seen in how you can approach the gameplay differently. Also get in a guild (outfit) they really change how the game works and you can have a lot of fun in them even if you got no friends to play with. "}
{"text" : "Zombidle: REMONSTERED is a title that every clicker fan should miss. The programmers from Berzerk Studio, which is probably known to a large number of players for their mini-games at a really high level, have shown that they can also afford to create one of the best clickers I have had the opportunity to play. The graphics and animations that are often missing in clickers are at a really high level. In addition, we can connect our account with the version for mobile devices, which gives us a greater possibility of progression.

It goes down into the underworld, past sunken temples, deadly biomes, up to the glowing core with all its terrible creatures. On the way there, you have to forge new armor and weapons that gradually transform a weak loser into a radiant hero. And then it's time to face the real monsters of this world.

{"text" : "I honestly haven't heard anything about this game, but I love horror. The page of this game is not clear what interested you, because looking at the screenshots it is generally not clear what awaits you. Probably this and bribed. And, despite the fact that nothing was clear from the screenshots, they were beautiful. I decided to tackle it thoroughly. I put on the biggest headphones I could find, turned off all the lights, turned the volume up and ... ... and, damn it, I liked it! The first two chapters, I actually grumbled from every rustle, because it is not clear what they are going to scare us with. Will these be screamers? Or maybe there will be just an oppressive atmosphere and I just wind myself up? It was incomprehensible. It was clear only that IT WORKS. This is just a random quote from the Internet, which spins in the language all the time I write a review) In fact, the unknown is more frightening than what is in this game. Needless to say that closer to the middle, you will already know what to expect from this game and the effect will become much weaker, but here it comes into play ... Yes, it is presented completely unoriginal and even very primitive (perhaps?) but you're wondering "what the hell is going on here?" and you play on. Perhaps I will stop here, because it seems to me that the desired effect can be achieved only if you do not know what awaits you. You seem to be reading this review, I probably already added a game to the basket, but let's wait. the game is actually very boring. I don’t know, maybe something didn’t work for me, or maybe it was just something buggy, but most likely it was intended. In general, the fact is that there are very few items in the game to interact with and you often have to wander around. Roundtrip. Wander back and forth in order for a room to open. This is very boring and annoying, but even worse, it is confusing. However, I liked the fact that many things need to be thought out in order to move forward. The end will be very sad. If you undertake to play, then, please, follow the plot. You will be rewarded with a very sad touching story that will make someone think, make someone say in a half-whisper "pussy * ts", and someone will be deprived of sleep for the next night. I liked the game, despite the fact that it is short. This is the case when something is good until it gets bored. "God's basement" ended on time and did not have time to get bored. In general, the very idea of ​​the game is interesting. Okay, a little about the game: This is hardly a spoiler, because the player learns about this at the beginning of the game from the Operator. All in all, buy at a discount and have a "terrible" evening playing this game. It's worth it) "}

I didnt know what to expect from it, but after it loaded and the gameplay began, I was truly impressed by the graphics and smooth engine. But that is not all, at first it looked like very simple straightforward 2D game, but as I was able to beat it first time, I started the second run, and discovered so many new secrets and different strategies. Animations looks awesome, characters and level design is so cute, music and sound effects really enjoyable. It also has steam achievements which I especially like, and completed 100% of them. But than I found out that this will probably be everything we will ever get of this game, bcs their kickstarted failed and development of this amazing game ended. It is such a sad story, and also it could be found in game, if you explore every corner of it.

{"text" : "After more than 250 hours of playing time, I can definitely say that this is a really great role-playing game. Quests: The quests are very varied. They are not alike, and there is not a single typical hunter-gatherer quest, which surprised me in a very pleasant way. In addition, each has a story and was designed to be exciting. Which is also a big + point that you can solve the quests in different ways, and also have corresponding effects and consequences. Dialogues: Simply fantastic! The developers really thought of it, and you can tell that they have invested a lot of love and time in the dialogues. Many are funny, you start to smile, some are also sad, and others are exciting. By the way, big praise to the voice actor who repeatedly describes the NPC's RP moderately (their looks, their feelings, and their way of thinking). Characters and Companions: Each character is unique. Each companion has its own story, and so-called loyalty missions that you can or should fulfill because you learn more about the background story of the respective character and thus the popularity increases. You have a free choice in terms of skill points and abilities. However, one should be clear in advance how the character should ultimately be in the fight, and what role he plays in it, otherwise it can be quite difficult in the later fights. Of course, it also depends on the level of difficulty. Die Welt: Everything is wonderfully done here too. There is really a lot of love behind it here too. You can also tell from the details in this beautiful big world that contains many secret quests and treasures. It invites you to explore and is by no means boring or monotonous like in many other games. The story: It is exciting from the start, as are the many side missions. I won't say more about it ;-) Conclusion: Everyone who likes long role-playing games and turn-based strategy games is an absolute must. I have definitely not regretted the purchase and can only really recommend it! I hope I was able to help a little further with this review, and I wish everyone a lot of fun and enjoyment with this game! =) "}

How you play is all up to you, but the game encourages recklessness, which is likely to get you killed since you die in one hit.

{"text" : "For 16 years now I have been a big fan of the World of Darkness, VTM, and Legacy Of Kain universes. Participated in many urban role-playing in these settings. And now, when, it seemed already nothing even approximately as chic as VTM: Bloodlines will not come out, a year ago I got acquainted with a creation called Vampyr. And so, as it has been with me for a long time, I first go through a new product without buying it, and if I liked it, then I definitely purchase a License. So it happened with Vampyr. Overall, it took me exactly 45 hours to fully re-learn the game, collecting EVERYTHING in it, and getting all the Steam achievements and all the endings of the game. The vacation allowed me to enjoy the game calmly. And here's what I can write about it: The game amazed with its soundtrack (pleasant sounds of bowed strings in the theme of Vampirism, and even under the scenery of the gloomy streets of London, struck by an epidemic - an ideal combination!). I am pleasantly surprised by the plot. The hero changes and develops throughout the game, depending on your actions. The battle is not the most convenient, but I liked it when I got used to it. Valuable but honest approach "Eat or you will be eaten", sometimes makes you think about eating "peaceful" citizens, because towards the end of the game, "Human", the weak character starts to get nuts more and more often. The RPG component is quite simple and concise, but it suits my style of play. The dialogue component is not the most interesting, but it allows realizing the character of the character. We were also pleased with the endings, of which there are 4 pieces, and definitely "black" and "white" among them are not the only ones. The "gray" endings are also quite playable and only allow you to devour a few people who, in my humble opinion, deserve it. Total: Gameplay - 9/10 Music - 10/10 !!! Voice acting - 10/10 Translation - 8/10 (noticed a couple of inaccuracies in the subtitles when translating speech) Plot - 9/10. Combat - 8/10 RPG component - 9/10 Replay value - 7/10 (once a year, one and a half can be replayed). "}

Something interesting to say about this game, is that if 1 player of the team does not dominate the class they are playing, IT WILL NOT ROLL! Something I really like about Evolve is the way the story is told. The story is first presented in a video introduction, and throughout the gameplay the characters talk to each other, and that's when the players take the pieces of the story and gather the facts. I recommend Evolve to everyone who enjoys a good multi-cooperative and feeling of being on a hunt. #HappyHunting "}

The game is made for the majors and their children, as well as for lazy assholes, no, there is not such a wild donation, everything is done for you, you just need to choose to aim and shoot. All attachments are put on the weapons themselves ... You don't need to hold your breath ... Perhaps it would be worth adding crafting and buildings ... but wait, this is a different game. I'll tell you about the disadvantages of the game: - Graphics (Daddy's graphodrochem will not work) - Arcade (There are no attempts at realism, this is a stupid arcade shooter with terrible animation) - Bugs and cheaters (Since I want to remain the top player without defeats, I will not check, but in the reviews they bombard) - Logic (You immediately chose where on earth, but how did you get there and what you forgot there, only the developer knows) Now about the advantages of the game: + It is free (Most it is, if you do not have money for the pubg) + Optimization (From the reviews it is quite good, if the pubg does not go, this will work, but this is not accurate) + Ideas (Instead of circles, there are polygons. You are right on the ground where you want. At the end of the game there are 4 "chairs") + Character Editor ( Now you can make the "iPhone collector" suitable for you) + Snowboard As a result, the game is 6/10, there is something special in it.

In the game, you can customize the car. For example, choose your rubber, hat, antenna, paint and even nitro effect. The game also contains paid DLC, the purchase of which adds the above items and new cars. We can talk a lot, let's move on to the assessment. Pros - + Nice graphics + Hurricane gameplay (cool pokatushki) + Huge choice of personalization of your car + Music (just shakes, especially the initial track "Ring") + Inexpensive DLC + A lot of fun and fun (unless of course your friend is a whiner, and will not scream the whole game - "well, where have you been?" or "Go to the stump, the ball was at the gate!") Cons - - If you want to get all the achievements, you will have to pay off 300 rubles, + spend a lot of time on getting achievements. I don't see any more cons. Total - 8/10.

There are many things you can do to play well, but most of all you need time. 3 months after I bought the game, I could only start playing well, although I can't say that I played that great right now, but I do manage it: D You can download the training maps from the workshop and improve yourself, the training maps are really boring, but you need to work hard to play well: D After a while, constantly Cs: Go you want to play, you can not leave the game officially. The rank system is definitely one of my favorite things in the game, because you rank according to how you play, and you do not encounter any 'But this guy on the opposite team plays very well, we don't have a chance' since you play with people who play similar to yourself. One of the things I don't like the most is the Skins .... People are really idiots, including me. What's the need to pour billions for something that is just images in a video game? Unfortunately, I am attracted to this job, let's buy a weapon that you can use in the game, or if those skins bring a useful feature to the weapon, increase damage, etc. like ... nothing. Only image. Anyway, this issue gets longer and longer, as I said, the game connects you to yourself and you don't want to leave. I haven't played other Counter-Strike games, so I can't compare with them, but I was surprised that I liked a game that I didn't want to buy at first. I hope you learned something about the game from my review, thanks for reading! : 3 ^^ I completed 1 year in the game, and when I reread what I wrote above, I realized that I was wrong with some things. For example, the rank system is not good or something -especially after the new update- If you face high-rank smurf, that match will be gg. And after the new update, you lose almost 1 match, your rank will decrease. "}

{"text" : "The explosion in the orbit of the tiny planet, which was ruled by peace and uniformity, turned it into hundreds of pieces, presented in the form of puzzles scattered over the five acts of the game. During each of the acts, in addition to finding the hidden puzzles at the locations, we are offered to play various mini-games and collect one by one the necessary things to move to another location. Each of the locations enchants with an incredible picture with lots of details that look harmonious and hide many mysteries that do not immediately catch the eye. The whole story unfolds in locations and interactions with objects, no dialogues, the game allows you to enjoy the game, does not impose any plots, one small video with prehistory, and then you in a small world try to collect it in a pile in small pieces. Each of the characters fascinates with his charisma and indifference to the situation, they are busy with everyday life. The game, though not long, but does not have time to get bored and allows you to fully immerse yourself in the atmosphere that prevails on the planet. A great game in the style of Point & Click, which will allow you to be distracted on a cloudy day and absorb into an incredible world full of mysteries and charismatic silences. "}

I was a bandit - it doesn't even matter. "We condemn racism" - this thought can be highlighted in the message from the developers at the start of the game. This message is the main drawback of the game. Not monotonous tasks, not optimization, not damn reflections, finally. No. Lincoln Clay is already a bandit at the start of the game, kills and robbing people and this is presented by the developers as if we also have to empathize with HIM. Why? Because he's black. Therefore, everything is possible for him. Also, the priest in the background will constantly broadcast, oh, what a difficult childhood he had, oh, how unhappy he is, and those friends, bandits, with whom he robbed a federal warehouse for a minute, simultaneously killing a bunch of police officers, were his FAMILY. Is this character I should empathize with? He does not change in any way in the plot, he just continues to rob and kill, without thinking about the accompanying losses. This game is rotten from the inside and it cannot be fixed by any patches, what "good story" did you broadcast about, Loyev?

Of course, you can exclaim: "What the hell is the plot in shooters ?!" and you will be right in something. (It would seem that Serious sam has neither a special plot nor perks, but Sam took the brightness of the locations and a varied bestiary. And in the same FEAR there was a plot and the motives of the hero were clear, and the AI ​​of the enemies became the standard.) add pleasant lighting and complexity, but mostly the most annoying things are present: solid monotonous black corridors like an African's ass and a muttering robot grandma with a "partner" who are trying to humor and build skirmishes among themselves. Well, the main character jokes in the manner: "Ohh you have such a big gun, do you compensate for the size in another place?" And it is not necessary to say that this is supposedly from the developers who released any slag, and now they seem to be taking the path of correction. So definitely not good. If you are somewhat stubborn and like to fill all sorts of counters, without going into either the general plot or the motivation of the hero and you don’t care who to shoot at all, then think for yourself, decide for yourself.

{"text" : "Long ago, there once was a land called “The Floor” where rainbows shone brightly, the sky was filled with marshmallow clouds, the most beautiful flowers sprawled across vast meadows and unicorns pooped the sweetest gum drops. The cutest critters from all over played together in peace, held hands and sang in harmony, oblivious of what was about to come.  The lands were ruled by a mysterious overlord, whose name was unwritten and unspoken. The overlord was kind to the critters, providing them new and enjoyable playthings. However, over the course of time, the overlord’s heart would become poisoned and corrupted, lured by future promises of vast new lands and riches.  All was well until a dark sky began to form. Rumours amongst the critters began to sprout like new leaves on a sapling. An emerging threat was ready to strike fear into all that was innocent and pure. A few moons later, a hideous, remorseless and grotesque beast was released by the overlord. The beast was given many names, Beelzebub, Pazuzu , Barbra Streisand, Azazel or EGS. Many critters fled, but those who stayed would soon learn the ugly truth and the horrid realisation of their impending doom. As the beast and its hordes propagated, the rainbows disappeared into the darkness, the clouds poured acid rain and the once colourful meadows turned to ash and despair. Those that remained became infected with the beast’s BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH and their world had come CRASHING down. Parts of the land became DESYNCHRONISED and the critters were soon CUT OFF from their friends. More critters attempted escape, but those that LAGGED behind in the cold emptiness FROZE and soon tasted the beast’s venomous tongue to be tenderised and consumed. For a price, the critters where offered golden trinkets, which glinted from the suns faint rays of hope sneaking through the dark cloudy skies. But alas, souls were the only currency used to satisfy the overlord and its insatiable hunger.  All that was beautiful had disappeared and what remained were the broken shattered bodies of tired and exhausted critters, struggling and begging for life while been picked at like a ravenous vulture by the beast and its’ overlord.  At least a real vulture waits until your dead. "}

In fact, apart from the prologue, ending and some moments, the whole essence of the game is to: get to the chelik, talk to him, slowly cause damage to a certain business, driving around the area back and forth, and either interrogating someone, or killing, or destroying a batch of weapons / slot machines, etc., or stealing money, or something else. In fact, it's the same everywhere. Absolutely everywhere. So, having inflicted some damage on the business, we go again to the chelik, talk to him, then we kill the little mongrel. And we do ALL OF THE ABOVE again, but with a different business. At the end, we again kill the small mongrel. Later we go and kill the capo (a larger mongrel). Maybe there will be another task in this area to kill (most often, occasionally rescue) one of Marcano's people. Then we capture the area and give it to one of the allies. And that's all. ALL. And so the whole game. We do the same thing throughout the game. The same thing. The game has 9 districts and no variety. - Optimization. Even on the most powerful PCs, the game manages to lag. Personally, I had to play at low graphics settings, but in FULL HD, so that I played an average of 45 FPS. And that's quite normal for this game, don't be alarmed. This is Mafia 3. - Graphics. I won't say anything. It's good for, say, 2013. And yes, how soapy the game is. The whole game is one solid soap. Even Drake himself would be jealous. - Secondary tasks. This is either generally just a conversation, or tasks like "Go - kill", "Go - steal". - Vito's story. I expected a lot more than what I saw in the game. Everything is done so poorly, so badly, that I think any fan of the series would write a much better script. - AI. Some people say he's smart and all. No. Artificial intelligence is incredibly dumb. - Bugs. Oh, in the early stages of the game after release - it was something. Now this is less, but nonetheless. - Flaws in certain aspects, which is only one reflection in the mirror. Dampness of the game, ill-conceivedness, and so on. - Policemen. Remember them from the first two parts. We were even fined for speeding. And here? I won't say anything again. - Remember the fights in Mafia 2? It was awesome. And here? Press the key and our main character kills NPCs with one crooked blow with a crooked animation. - The main character. He's absolutely nothing. He doesn't want to empathize, nothing. And I said that there will be many cons. But is there anything good about this game? There is. - Music is the best thing in the game. - The atmosphere of the 60s. transmitted perfectly. Environment. - Shooting. It's really nice to shoot. - Driving. It's nice to drive, I really feel it. I liked this aspect of the game. - Regarding the plot and gameplay, at least a little higher, I completely criticized them, but still, at least a little, but there is something good. I liked the very presentation of the plot - all these inserts from the future (if you know what I mean) and all that. In some moments, there really is something to think about and be sad. Prologue, ending (partly) and some cutscenes. A couple of interesting missions. These are the only pluses. Everything else is just solid cons. - Well, I will give one more plus for Vito and Leo. So, summing up, what do we have? The game is more than completely degraded compared to the last two parts. This is no longer Mafia, but another "GTA-like" game. There is something in her, definitely. Still, I went through the game to the end and it pulled me in. But against the background of all the minuses, the pluses almost completely dissolve. Do I recommend this game to you? If you haven't played the previous parts, then no. I don't want to spoil your impression of this series of games. Go through the previous parts first (both games are masterpieces, some of the best games I've ever played), and only then, if you wish, then try Mafia 3. Why not. At least purely for fun. If you have gone through the past parts. Or at least the second (although I think the first part is the best, but still) and you have a desire to try Mafia 3 - try it. Nobody will suffer from this. But still it's a shame, because they had everything possible to make another masterpiece. "}
{"text" : "Polyventure, while having great music and some immersive environments is a very experimental, EXTREMELY minimalistic game. While I am a fan of experimental, abstract, and minimalistic walking sims this game simply doesn't have enough depth to it beyond enjoying a few chill songs while wandering around static, somewhat ethereal environments.  Polyventure seems to be more or less just about wandering around strange locales while a chill "Pure Moods" ish sounding song plays in the background. While I was initially very captivated with the game and its opening Enigma - Sadeness sounding tune, it quickly became apparent that the game involved very little (to no) player interaction, instead consisting of the player meandering aimlessly about while a snippet of a song plays, looking at a few things (are all of the environments shown in the trailer?) before being warped out of that environment and onto the next "hub" area which has 4 pillars of colorful light (seen in the trailer) that the player can walk into. These are all unique but once inside of them there is no purpose to the player to complete (which is fine...) but save for one area involving some optional platforming along clouds there doesn't seem to be any player interaction required at all in Polyventure. Although I still enjoyed the music and can admire Polyventure as a piece of interactive "art" or as an interesting way to market the musical tracks, I can't recommend it at its baseline asking price of 4.99. Had the songs also been packaged into a soundtrack on Steam, then it would be a kind of cool experimental EP to pick up, however marketed in its store description as "a game based on beautiful atmospheres and lucid dreaming, to concern about endangered species and the enviroment" is injecting far more purpose into the title than is evident to any of the player during their sparse interactions with the level design.

{"text" : "Could be a good game, and is to a degree, but the negative scrolls and poor balancing make this nothing more than a lesson in futility. The game quite often (like every time without fail) removes all your good weapons that took you hours to find without recourse, and hits you with unfair negative stats. Because of this, the only character capable of beating a pyramid is the weakest one, which is Sekhmet the healing class, because of the higher defense and healing ability. No other class can compensate for bad scrolls, and this ruins the fun of the game. Some of the more fun characters that start with better weapons also have ridiculously low defensive stats, and the tank guy has reduced speed and jumping capability, making him completely useless in harder pyramids. Beating a pyramid also resets your character, so you have to beat the next one from scratch.  Because of the horrendously poor game balancing, and constant bad scroll pickups, you will die and restart constantly, and eventually become too frustrated to play the game anymore. I've maxed out most of my upgrades, and cannot get past the 3rd pyramid. Mostly because of the bad scroll drops, which instantly ruin your run. Recommendation: Buy Strafe instead, as Strafe allows you to reset bad upgrades, buy ammo and health, buy useful upgrades, and has better level design. Immortal Redneck has fancier graphics, but that's all it has. The game is nothing but unbalanced and frustrating, and I don't think the IR devs care to fix it, unlike the Strafe devs. Total Biscuit was right to give this game a negative review, because even though the devs addressed some of the problems, the negative scrolls remain in the game, and it ruins the experience.

In the end, humanity staged an apocalypse, degraded once again, losing at the same time verbal communication skills, switching to insane Down's gibberish, well, or someone was too lazy to voice dialogues. Although, it is better to have such an indistinct dialect as in the CHUCHEL game (reminded me very much) than empty subtitles. For the rest, the game practically does not stand out among the huge set of games about zombies on mobile phones: according to the classics, hordes of corpse are pressing on the left and right, there are several types of zombies, as it should be, pumping there is some kind of different weapon, the camp / hub from which the exit to mission and in general it is the whole skeleton of the game. There are also nice features - the game is not completely two-dimensional, you can move along the level, slightly down and partly up, passing dangerous sections of the location with stealth. What caused the game to be postponed until better times was unreadable fonts and lack of text scaling with the interface. It is impossible to disassemble something by going into the green-acid inventory menu, in order to see the list of crafting you need to have binoculars with you. In one scene, the NPC has subtitles on the floor of the screen, and in other places you cannot make out anything, but I would really like to, because the game has an element of base pumping, but I do not understand what actions the game expects from me. To pump this thing, the name of which I don't see and what ingredients are needed there? 2 cat asses and a little dill? The interface for indie is generally clear and does not contain anything superfluous, but again there is a problem with fonts. If you can still fix the fonts and this is not critical, then why the hell in a game in which you do not want to understand at all like in some 3 witcher, adding some additional card games is not entirely clear. I wouldn't be surprised if most of the community drops the game on the second mission, where you have to play local gwent, in a game in which you just want to go in to shoot zombies, not solve puzzles. Don't beat me, but I didn't even understand what the rules were in this gwent, I tried to cancel everything and dropped the game. Hopefully the developer solves the problem with the acid-torn interface and fonts. "}

The game is buggy, I regularly encounter games where the monster gets stuck in the terrain somehow. A week in it's already difficult to find matchmaking games. The last time I tried playing with a three I went two rounds with an AI monster and trapper, eventually giving up because the AI trapper refused to use their dome and we were unable to catch the monster. Then you're stuck with boring games where you don't find the monster until they hit level three and you can't fight him anymore, or the ones where you immediately trap and kill him. The game is fun for a while if you have enough people to play with, but I definitely wouldn't recommend at the $60 price tag.

{"text" : "I confess that I bought the game impulsively and impressed by the amazing movie A Fistful of Dollars with Clint Eastwood I watched this morning. There was no question of high expectations; the quality of this project could already be estimated from the screenshots. The gameplay trailer, unfortunately, was ignored. It doesn't look so bad, though. And the introduction is stylish. But the game doesn't even reach "Not so bad". Everything is very, very bad ... The game meets with a long load time and a rather stylish menu. First of all, I wanted to get into the EXTRA tab. In it, you can track your stats and rank, which was pretty nice to see. But the second point of this tab was scary. Great and terrible "SKINS". Here the unpleasant bitter taste of the upcoming experience has already appeared. There are 3 skins for each weapon in the game. And all skins are purchased for money ... Okay, the "OPTIONS" tab. Only their description is poorer than local settings and there is absolutely nothing to do here. I don't think for a long time, I started searching for a game. I was not particularly surprised to see an empty server list. After poking around in different regions, I made sure that not a single person on the planet except me plays "this". It became a little sad and lonely. Thank gods there are bots. Launched a match for 6 people. Very long loading time. Extremely long. As if they were trying to cheat the players for 2 hours at her expense so that the game could not be returned. I already wanted to leave and coffee, as a miracle happened and the game started. Immediately horrible graphics bit into my eyes. In surprise, I double-checked the settings. Everything was at the "maximum". Okay, I'm not a graphew. But I can't close my eyes to bad optimization, which is the topic of one of the 2 discussions of the game in the Community Center. Gritting my teeth, I began to play. There is nothing to say about the gameplay. If you've ever played a bad indie shooter on Unity, then you already know how things are. Unresponsive management. Clumsy animations. No shooting. Horrible, again, graphics and graphical artifacts on most cards. From the moonshiners, there is only the name and model of the hilka in the form of a check. There are a lot of weapons, but it is not pleasant to shoot from them. And why is it necessary if a knife kills with one throw ?! There are two types of bots here: stupid dummies running from side to side and begging you to end their suffering; well, and MLG-Clint Eastwoods, thrusting 6 bullets into you in a jump and throwing a knife at your head across the map. I tried four cards. Of these, I can only mention Station. She's pretty pretty. Do you want to know what is NOT beautiful here? Voice acting and sound effects. Weapons sound fake. The sound is often jammed. The announcer's voice ... he needs more practice. It's funny that despite the general technical imperfection, the developers invested in nothing such an effect when you go to the menu via Esc. Stylish, ep. In general, this absolutely terrible experience is saved only by music! Cool driving metal and classic Western whistling cheer up during loading and help not topple the table in a fit of anger. And the effect from the menu. He is tough. "}

The reality is very common, but it will not be included in the game because it is awkward. The biggest drawback of this game should be the lack of plot.

{"text" : "So..Stonehearth. What a lovely concept for a game and what a pitty how it fails at keeping me as the player interested in it.. The idea of Stoneheart is a simple one, you build your own little village with your own litte villagers in it.  And everything can be designed by yourself, you plan and build the houses brick by brick, choose your farmingland, your plants and your defencelines. This game with it's minecraft-like buildingoptions and the sweet, yet simple art should be right down my alley...buuut it ain't and after 17 or so hour in I can tell you why: Boredom.  Stoneheart sadly lacks stuff to do in it. After you build your village a bit, adress jobs to your villagers and and draw a wall around it the game is kind of over. You get attacked from time to time and you can use your guys to explore the map a bit, but the attacks are repetitive and the map is quite small and empty as such.  Of course there is a goal to the game, to elevate your village into a city under an unseen king, but to get the items to achieve this boring and unchallenging grinding is needed.  Not my type of tea. So in the end Heartstone, eh I mean Stoneheart is not bad on paper..just kind of on PC.  It's a nice and sweetlooking game, but nothing that could keep you entertained for long. In my books that's a _4/10_, not a bad game, but not the right one for me. "}

You need to have a normal checkpoint system, and not throw me back to the beginning of the level, although before that everything was fine.

The real issue  is that you can cast your spells in pause and remove your cooldowns with gems. So theroretically you can cast infinite spells, what makes even the heroic levels a joke - if you have enough gems farmed. Another issue is the balance. I mean there are levels where you could let all creeps through and wouldn't loose - because you have more lives than there are enemies in this level.

You can pick up, eat, change and upgrade a lot of things, but surprisingly it slows down the gameplay more. And with all the abundance of everything "picked up" there is not enough cartridges for the weapon you like, which, of course, is very ironic)) The 2D platformer shooter lying at the root here is also not very bright. The platformer is some kind of extremely "sharp" due to the need to constantly use the hero's dash on the half-screen, which does not really combine with small platforms and occasional spikes. The combat component is a kind of "dancing on a small piece of the screen", since most of the weapons have a small distance, and the overwhelming majority of enemies are either for melee or have an area attack around them. There are also enemies that shoot projectiles, but their speed is so high that you cannot dodge them.

{"text" : "It shouldn't call itself a game whose only feature in common with that genre is the style of the map, because the rest is a want and I can't. The, which is what makes you have a good time in a game of this type, is fatally implemented: not only is it anecdotal but it is also unnecessary. When you want to pick up the objects that you have been leaving behind, you are already in a part of the map without communication or transport with the areas where you left things to collect, which forces you to take a good walk to the first area that has communication with the rest. As if that were not enough, the walk is even less appealing if possible when you realize that the objects you collect are completely unnecessary to complete the game. They consist of a series of materials to build improvements, which can be changed at save points. Well, practically all the improvements you can build have no or limited usefulness. After trying several and not knowing if the one you have chosen works or not, you end up making the decision that it is best to equip the upgrade that limits the damage you take three times. I am convinced that I could have finished the game without picking up anything and without having any of the upgrades equipped. To improve this, the number of weapons is only 4 (3 guns and the wrench), and there are no abilities to unlock (forget double jump, and the like). Special mention to the control of the character Mina. Her movement is restricted with respect to the main character and pointing her weapon is utter nonsense. Fortunately, you control this character a few times and for a short time throughout the game. The plot is not bad and could be perfectly that of any Final Fantasy (what's more, I think Iconoclasts would be a better game if it had been a classic J-RPG with turn-based combat), as a platform game it works well (I say more, I think Iconoclasts would have been a better game had it been exclusively a story-centric 2D action platformer), the puzzles are well posed and the artwork is good. I am a huge lover of the genre, so much so that it has become my favorite genre over the years, and I really wanted to play Iconoclasts. I can already say that it is one of the biggest disappointments I have had in recent years as a player, and I can say without hesitation that it is one of the worst I will ever play. If you have it on your wish list and you are looking for one, buy another one that is on your list. Luckily there are various proposals to choose from. "}

{"text" : "What can I say after the first passage of the game - it's worth it to buy and go through. Interesting plot, there are colorful characters, good portrayal and atmosphere, as for a game of this genre. But at the moment there are huge disadvantages: - Exorbitant incomprehensible requirements for graphics. - Glitches. Glitches and more glitches. Both graphical and broken scripts, sometimes disappearing Russian voice acting, buggy subtitles that are disabled when loading a game from an autosave. - Russian voice acting does not always coincide with Russian subtitles. Voices are not always well chosen, so it is better to play with English voice acting and Russian subtitles. - The game has collectibles (collectible cards for athletes). So - their location in the game is RANDOM (100 pieces of cards can appear in 150 places), i.e. when passing the game for different players, they will be located in different places. Considering that finding them is difficult due to clumsy control, not always good camera angles and big problems with raising them, even if you see these cards in front of you, collecting these cards is a real headache. - There is an achievement to get all the endings. Taking into account the system of saves, the game will have to be replayed completely 2 times with an additional replay of the last save 3 times for each endings. For this genre, it is meaningless and merciless. - Unmissable dialogues. How many game developers stepped on this rake, but it is clear that this does not teach anyone. Considering several playthroughs, a lot of time is wasted on what has already been seen and heard. - QTE. Small QTE icons, short response time, and given the fact that there are a lot of dialogues, you can simply skip some QTE, which usually ends with the death of the main character, and again you will have to listen to a lengthy unmissable monologue / dialogue. - Dialogue timers are VERY SHORT. It is very difficult to read all versions of the answers and have time to click the one you need. At this stage, I DO NOT ADVISE the game. Technically, a VERY "RAW" project. After the last patch in April 2020, the game earned buggy achievements before this, an official guide to finding collectible cards appeared, but unmissable dialogues, untranslated replicas in some places (laboratory) remained.

You have to move your crosshairs with the WASD keys and fire by holding the Spacebar until your dude decides to pop out of cover and fire.  Naturally, there's no options menu in-game, so you can't adjust your sound settings, redefine your keys, or set up Y-inversion without exiting the game in order to change settings in the launcher.  And once you exit, you won't want to launch it again.  Hence my play time.  I've seen all I need to. Turns out Steam won't let you review a game if you less than 5 minutes of playtime, so I   have to launch it a second time.  I mapped shooting to the LMB but that doesn't solve much.  There's not much reason to do anything more than hold down the fire key while pressing A and D to look around and mow dudes down.  Other than snipers who appear above the normal dudes (and I think they use a sound effect ripped from  ).  To move from cover to cover?  You have to CLICK the big arrows on the side of the screen.

{"text" : "Duke Nukem Forever is an action-based first-person shooter. Players take control of Duke as he navigate through a series of levels which take place on Earth. The game allows players to interact with various in-game objects, including urinals, water coolers and whiteboards which allow players to draw their own images. The gameplay is similar in some respects to the first-person shooter games of the past, with each level culminating in a boss battle in which Nukem has to fight and kill Battlelords. Unlike in the previous games, Nukem can only hold two weapons at any one time in a manner similar to the Halo franchise, although Pipe Bombs and laser tripwires are considered inventory items and as such are not limited by this restriction. Items that have an effect on Nukem can be picked up by the player; these items consist of are steroids, beer, and a Holoduke. Steroids increase the strength of Nukem's melee attacks by a great deal for a certain time. Beer makes Duke much more resistant to damage, but blurs the screen. A holoduke creates a hologram of Duke Nukem that looks and acts in a very similar way to Duke, but often says slightly different versions of his one-liners. While the holoduke is in effect, Nukem becomes invisible and the AI characters do not recognize his presence. The Jetpack also returns, but only in multiplayer. Instead of the health system featured in the previous Duke Nukem game, in which health would be depleted when Nukem was injured and would only increase upon finding a health pack, drinking water from fountains/broken fire hydrants or using the portable medkit special item, Duke Nukem Forever employs a system involving an "ego bar" similar to Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project. The ego bar depletes when Nukem is attacked; once it is fully depleted, Nukem is susceptible to damage. If the player avoids further damage the ego bar is restored, as is Nukem's health. The player can increase the size of the ego bar (thus increasing the amount of damage Nukem can take) by interacting with certain items throughout the game (for example, a mirror), and by defeating bosses. The game employs a saving system that is solely based on checkpoints. ●Stable Frame Rate ●Decent Shooting Mechanics ●Various Online Modes ●Reasonable Amount Of Content ●Outdated Storyline  ●Bland,Boring Visuals ●Poorly Imitates "Valve" Inspired Physics Based Puzzles ●Frustratingly Long Platforming Sequences ●Dead Multiplayer Playing the previous installments of the franchise sets a pinnacle for this game, but almost everything about this game makes the previous much older games look comparatively superior and puts a nail in its own coffin. As the game slowly progresses it fells like it is just going down-hill and downgrading on fun. Duke Nukem Forever gives u the plan boring vibe which sometimes becomes downright untolerable. It doesn't polish on a single gameplay mechanic which makes it feel slightly unfinished, I personally can't recomend this game less there are various much better alternatives out there. "}

With that aside, I did ironicaly "enjoyed" the gameplay to an extent back at the beginning of early access release. It was clunky, lag of 2 seconds for everyone, not optimized and content was 2 maps and 1 weapon. But the community was golden and a true joy to be with.  As years went by, the dev gave us 1 more weapon and a couple of maps. Multiplayer was optimized to a ok amount, lag reduced to under a second. But the dev only worked on the multiplayer, which was supposed to be a feature to make you wait while they were supposed to "work" on the coop story driven game it was promised to be. Except, they did made a journal in which they revealed they didn't even start working on it. Community became scared. Dreams and hope faded. An another year and one last weapon saw the dev reaching out to the community to give them another huge amount of money in order to "fix" the game. Needless to say, the rapidly dying community didn't react well to this and it ended in failure. So they asked the few remaining die hard fans to find them a "visionnary investor" ready to loose a huge amount of cash to make the studio able to continue doing everything else then good work. That didn't work either. Now, only the owner of the studio is left and he said he was not abandonning this game, even though he had to get a proper work in which he actually has to give results if he doesn't wanna be fired. This game will never be completed even if it leaves early access one day. If that happens, it just means the dev died or finally came back to reality. Tldr: This project promised the world. The promise was made by someone with no skill in game development and company management. Me and a bunch of other sheeple thought it was a gold mine and threw a lot of money at him. He was able to live in his dream for the next 5 to 10 years. Wasting this money in poor management of time, ressources and employee skills. Hopefully, he didn't finance a luxury life with it but who am I kidding. How can you blow half a million dollar without achieving to complete 10% of a game basic (movement, Ai, core mechanics). Don't buy, you have been warned! Where are my space Killer Sharks from hell... "}

Labeled products like slasher, female altruist and 2D, and the game is mostly action like Duck Stories or Chip and Dale, who back in the 90s crushed children's farts with their "unpretentious" jumping on platforms for half an hour.

{"text" : "I wish there was a "mixed" review button on Steam. I don't want to recommend this game, neither do I want to not recommend it. There are a lot of aspects about this game that I really like, such as the graphics, the optimization, the gameplay mechanics and even the campaign. There's just so much that could be done to make it better. The biggest thing that NEEDS to be done is dedicated servers; Ubisoft, you're charging a hefty £40 of our hard earned cash for this game, another £30 for the season pass AND you have in-game purchases? But you can't pay for dedicated servers? Hmm... Now I've played some peer to peer multiplayer games before and the majority of them work quite well, it's just this one doesn't. I've played a few matches now and once it starts to migrate to a new host because somebody has left, the game has a tendancy to stop the game indefinitely, forcing you to alt+tab from the game and close the window.  The only multiplayer game mode which stands out to me from around the five that Ubisoft have generously put into this game (yes, five game modes for £40) is the duel/brawl mode. This is because this seems to be the only game mode in which players can fight fairly; it reminds me of a Souls type duel. In other game modes players are free to leave the brawl at any time, run off and pick up buffs and more health, and even liasing with other team mates so that they can all well and truly massacre you - although you should have won the fight fair and square. And then once you've been slaughtered by around 4 other players, somebody decides to leave and you all have to wait for the peer to peer connection to fix itself, infuriating you even more so that you alt+tab from the game and write an angry review (like me!).  Now, there are alternatives to this. Ubisoft has added the option to play with AI's, nothing but AI's, which I have tried because it is near impossible to play a full multiplayer match... This would be good if the AI weren't so stupid. ESPECIALLY your own team. We're talking one of your fellow AI team-mates standing around 5 feet away from you, doing nothing and watching your life, and dignity, being taken by three enemy AI players.  The campaign has started very well and I am looking forward to playing it. The graphics are outstanding and the game is very well optimized. The fighting mechanics are some of the best I've come across, if not THE best, and I believe future sword/slashing games should follow a similar style.  The game has a lot of potential to be really fun, and I believe it will be in due time. Remember, Rainbow Six Siege wasn't that great when it first came out - now it's praised. I believe Ubi will listen and make this a great game. So my honest advice is to pick it up then, not now. "}

{"text" : "******************Addition to the Review (March 2016)****************** (This addition to the review is concerning the developer relations with his customers, for the game review please scroll down.) The developer is dishonest or doesnt care about his customers. I bought this game under the a christmas sale: "Celebrating Our Launch: Get an Extra Access Key FREE!" where the developer promised a second key to whoever buys the game during that time window. I did so, asked for a second key as the rest... Did not recieve it, also I tried to friend the developer so I can msg him about the issue, he ignored my friend request. A possible reason (an unjustified one) for his unintresst in providing me a second key (as promised) is my negative review on his product (was made monthes before this issue) This shameful way of him handling his customers are a cherry on top of his bad game. My recommendation stays: Stay Away & Don´t Support Developers Who Ignore or Lie to Their Customers. ****************Game Review (November 2015)**************** I really love Chess, and I am very happy when I see a version of it on Steam. Therefor I have really gave this game a chance but sadly I cannot recommend it whatsoever. - Tried to play for almost 2 hours and went as far as completing 2 moves... (most members are inactive) - Upon running the game for the first time Avira flagged the luncher as a virus. - After about 10, 15 minutes of having the game running it crashes (the browser that runs the game through steam) - The option of choosing different colors of pieces for the board doesnt seem to work yet. - The game provides the abillity to be ran through browser in order for it to be more accessible but sadly with a mobile phone only the profile can be opened but no chess piece can be moved. To summerize- sadly, a complete let down... Stay away.  For chess on Steam I would happily recommend "Simply Chess". "}

{"text" : "For me, Rockstar herself killed the game, with her behavior lately. First by cutting down on major updates, to only 2 major additions per year. This can still be experienced and understood by the Fates, because their forces were divided to support the RDO and, according to rumors, the development of new projects. In May 2020, unexpectedly and without warning, apart from rumors, the distribution of GTA 5 began in all the hated EGS. How can a game play spoil a score? It's that simple! Servers fell for a long time in the first days of distribution, after the server was optimized, but they still lag. The next thing is a huge abundance of cheaters who took a bunch of accounts for themselves. There was no anti-cheat in GTA, and now there will be 1-2 cheaters in every session. I'm not offended that many people got the 2013 game for free, I'm offended for a rash act on the part of the players. I think many have heard about the protests that are now taking place in the United States due to the murder of a person by the police during arrest. Publishers, companies and developers are supporting this event online. But Rockstar acted differently, distinguished from everyone. Rocky closed the servers of the GTAO and RDRO for 2 hours during the protest. The question is brewing, how should politics connect with the game? The person paid for the game, but he is forbidden to play. I understand that it is only 2 hours, this is a trifle, but an unpleasant act. P.S. NO RACISM "}

{"text" : "TLDR: This is a terrible launch, with multiple issues with connection, sound, and graphical errors. This is not the original Halo: Reach experience. Stop believing in 343, this is the third time they’ve ♥♥♥♥♥♥ us over.     Let's address the elephant in the room. This port was not to bring Halo fans their classic experience. It may have delivered on some of this, but this is, clearly, not 343’s intention. Rather, this was a quick cash-grab by them. This game was not ready to be released, and despite 343 saying “It’s ready when it’s ready,” they have once again taken advantage of players looking for a nostalgic return to their favorite childhood games. 343 made this game after seeing the success of ElDewrito. Don’t kid yourself. It also doesn’t matter that 343 will eventually fix these things and add in forge, theater, and the other games. They should’ve at least released a complete version of Halo: Reach, not this bare-bones stain on the franchise. By their own logic, this is true. Lets go over some of the objective problems first. ➤Audio has been a mess for hundreds of players, with everything sounding muffled.  ➤Playermodel issues. Your knee often gets stuck on your screen. Looks like a joke. ➤Voice and chat problems are everywhere, and most people can’t even get them to work. ➤For those that have gotten chat to work, there is an ungodly amount of censorship. →Seriously, to those defending this game, please explain this one away, it’s worse than nearly   any other game with this problem. The worst part is that it’ll most likely be overlooked.  ➤Major connection issues. I’ve seen, and been booted from several matches, and I’ve seen my friends booted from singleplayer campaign missions over the server connection.  ➤Key bindings, one of their most toted features, is incredibly bare-bones.  ➤Major issues with frames for most people. (Haven’t personally seen this one.) ➤Region-lock doesn’t work at all, so enjoy. ➤No Co-Op support. Didn't we just go through this with Halo: 5? Get your ♥♥♥♥ together people. I could go on and on, but there are more issues that I want to address, ones more on the subjective side.   ➤The lack of forge and theater. No more excuses nostalgia-fans. This should’ve been included in the game (by their own motto for game development). So what if they need to change the systems of theater (Which they don’t) to be compatible with all of the other game versions? "Bringing both features to PC is extremely complex and time consuming." It’s called game development, and 343 is backed by Microsoft. Do your job, and provide an actually decent experience for players. There is literally no excuse for forge. It’s a level editor, and complaining about how it’s hard to make it compatible with the mouse and keyboard just makes you look like a joke of a company (even more).  ➤The level-up system is just spitting in player’s faces. Seriously, they just took the pre-existing elements from the console MCC, and didn’t even bother to bring back the beloved level-up system of the original title. Fans have been begging for this level-up system to be incorporated into every Halo title since, and 343 has actually admitted that they might do so with the upcoming title. But they didn’t even do it with the actual port itself. So what’s up guys? Still sucking 343’s ♥♥♥♥, even when they spit in your face? Yep.   →The system is a visual clone of PUBG’s season pass system. It just doesn’t feature any actual cost. It takes away so much from Reach. If you liked the exclusivity of Recon Helmet, or the Red-Flaming Helmet effect, sorry to say, it’s gone. You can’t spend CR where you wanted to, rather, everyone will be unlocking certain items at the same time. I dread the day when everyone unlocked the birthday party headshot armor effect.  ➤(Nitpicking) 343 made some of the most ridiculous changes to the smallest and most needless things. Why can’t we have the classic black emblems anymore. Seriously? What the hell? No more black emblems? All we get is a slightly darker grey? No more cool emblem tricks, like the ONI emblem trick. They also reworked some of the emblems, changing how the layers work. WHY? You should’ve spent this time actually developing the game.  343 can go ♥♥♥♥ itself. But don't get me wrong, I'll still play the game, but 343 will never be getting another dime off of me. (Edited this review in order to satisfy the endless and mindless defenders of 343.) "}
{"text" : "This game is the worst fighting game I have ever played made by a AAA studio. 1. Netcode: This is the most important aspect of any online fighting game. The netcode is pure GARBAGE. Its extremely rare to find a match that doesnt lag, and the worst part of lag is that instead of slowing the game down like in USF4. Characters teleport, moves will give the hit confirm sound when the opponent is really blocking. This is not due to my internet, this has been the case at multiple locations. 2. Gameplay: Crush counter is the single worst mechanic in any fighting game ever. It makes counterhitting essentially the easiest thing in the world, it rewards pressing buttons and worst of all makes teching grabs a bad thing. It makes it so youre better off taking grab after grab instead of giving your opponent a giant punish. The combos for every character are so incredibly easy that it makes it no fun to learn the game. Despite capcom supposedly attempting to make sfv a more footsies game, footsies does NOT exist in SFV. 99% of play online is set play. Characters like mika and cammy are rewarded for mashing jab or any of their buttons, and get 50/50s after blockstrings where they are PLUS on block. what a load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. 3. Character design: Now I know alot of nerds like the fanservice and staring at 3d women while they jerk their little ding-dongs, but it does nothing for me.

I've been here for 15 years on steam, and pre-date steam with the first Counter-Strike. And with that being said, Valve needs to stop ignoring the community and start talking to us. This update? Free-to-play? Battle Royal?! It's far from anything anyone from /r/csgo or /r/valve ever would have asked for. We constantly ask for updates other Valve titles like TF2 and we get silence. This game was the best FPS i've ever played, and now it's something completely different. The competitive nature of it originally turned into something much more toxic and tainted. Loot crates were added, making the game feel based on weath, and the more and more people got crates the more they felt superior to others. People turned on other people making it such a toxic environment, and the competitivity grew and grew. Hackers were always a problem, and Valve was only minute on the subject. And if you want to know the brutally honest truth, it's that I still love this game. But with a sane mind, I can't reccomend it. "}

{"text" : "I'm okay with old games like Castlevania or Ninja Gaiden ... Probably because I haven't played them, huh ... Just because there are very crazy moments ... Like when the character is thrown back ten miles because he was hit with a doormat ... Or when you fall into an abyss or on thorns and it instantly counts as death (in fact, I'm still okay with this) ... Why am I writing this? If you also treat these games as I do, then by no means buy this game ... Never ... NEVER BL9 ... In just 7 hours, my ass experienced something that I have not experienced in any Dark Souls , not in any metroidvania, or in any platform game ... Either I forgot, or I really never burned so much ... To add shit from the NES era games to the game in 2019 is of course brilliant ... Here we have and knocking back ten miles, here we also have contact damage from enemies for ALL enemies and bosses, here we have a poor platforming with one-shot spikes that you can jump over if you don’t stand at the end of the platform, here we have enemies that cannot be bypassed (2d after all, bl9t) and you have to poke around for a hundred years to just bl9t go to the next room, here we have a parry mechanic that works, God forbid, on half of all the enemies in the game, here we have quick jumps on the walls, where you have to poke not only a jump, but hit button ... EVERY FUCKING TIME to just go upstairs (I fucked an ice location with this fucking wind that constantly blows you away, dick knows where), here we have a theme with clinging to the edges of the platform from the Metroid (xs from what part it went, but I first saw it in Zero Mission and Fusion), which works through the ass because the character clings to the platform when not needed (for example, when you want to jump into the hole) (+ I want to note that this action cannot be canceled, that is, you have to constantly fuck with the controls in order to just fall into the hole) ... I also note things that did not infuriate, but they also poured salt on this cake ... with shit ...> Things in the game have a lousy description ... To understand what the bead gives you need to scroll through the entire text ... Inconvenient ...> To understand something in the game, you need at least a little fumbling in church affairs ... At first I tried to somehow understand the text in the game, but to no avail ... Therefore, the "deep" plot bypassed me ...> Fuck you will understand what is needed for ... For example, there are places for offerings ... The game will never say what exactly you need to put there ... She will say th oh, it should be put only if the player already has this item ... Stupid garbage, especially considering that very little is clear from the description of objects ... (you can write off this to my stupidity, because I mainly rely on intuition)> Elevators ... I recall one of my favorite games, where the passage through which the elevator travels EXISTS BL9 ... If in this game you take the elevator from the lower floor to the upper one, and then jump into the abyss, then in theory the character should fall to the first floor, but went you fuck with your expectations, catch death ...> Everything in this game is soooo slow ... You can't skip the inscriptions (except for dialogues), the parries are long, which makes it unbearably boring, the usual fucking heal and that is slow to the ass ... for example, in some part of the DS (I don't remember exactly which one) it was possible to drink estuses quickly ... Immediately pour into yourself 2-3 without this long animation of taking out a can, etc. ... Fuck you, you drink each can half a year ... This is especially critical on bosses ... (I would not complain if the character was not about threw from one sneeze of the enemy fucking)> Enemies ... There are a lot of sprites, mechanic ... well, I would not say that little ... But when you meet enemies from past locations, then ... well, you begin to understand that here is a fantasy developers and ended ... I'll add another pinch of sugar, so to speak ...> Visually, the game looks awesome ... My inner lover of 2D and pixels appreciated the beauty of this game ...> The music in the game is good ... Not great, but good ... Like the sounds ...> There are many GOOD mechanics ... For example, Guilt ... It's like a punishment for death like in DS, only here you don't lose anything ... almost ... The character is taken away the maximum value of "mana" ... (mana is almost useless, but still a nice mechanic) ... Or, for example, bottles with hp ... To get an additional bottle, you need to fill it in a fountain for money ... Or, for example, if you kill a certain enemy , then the traps will not work in the room (this is a little useless, because the enemies are being cut, but oh well) ... I do, why am I writing this, I have just fucked up by this game and I wanted to write about it and warn people against buying ... Well, or at least warn about what shit is in this game ... I do not yet have the full right to rate the game, since I it has not passed yet, but in general I think that the ending will not change my opinion in any way ... If I am wrong, then I will rewrite the review after completing the game ... (I would hardly call it a review ... Rather, it's a cry souls) "}
{"text" : "Best Friend Forever is a visual novel dating sim coupled with dogs, sound like a winner right? Unfortunately what looks good on paper is executed poorly here.  The gameplay of Best Friend Forever is a very generic point and click dating story where you take of dogs in between. The characters are dull and the dialouges downright cringeworthy sometimes. The romances are also not given time to build up and feels extremely rushed. It took me around 2 hours to complete a selected route while taking care of the dog activities. Speaking ofdog activities, the dog part of the game feels tacked on just to appeal to more people. The care you take of your dogs does not effect the game in any significant way and its purely added for the sake of it. Since the characters are mostly bland, the short journey you take through the game is also farily bland. There is no spark between characters or a real feeling releatonship between you and your dog and it ends before it starts so the gameplay here is not good.  Visually Best Friend Forever, in my opinion, is not good. It goes for a cutesy artstyle but most of the characters and animations come off as jarring to say the least. The only thing I liked about the visuals here are the backgrounds and they are usually covered off by some bad looking characters. Some people might like this kind of visual style, it simply does not look good to me. Like the rest of the game, fairly generic. It does its job but you won’t remember it after the game is over. For this price tag, you can do far better than Best Friend Forever. It is short, generic, characters are bland and the story is incredibly rushed. It’s better to look for something else as there are far superior dating sims available for the same price.

For those of us expecting something new built off of Stellaris's success and differences from their past titles, this is not it.

{"text" : "Fast Detect is a Source-engine modification of Half-Life 2 developed and published by Russian developer Obergun. As I have heard from the main description, the main purpose of this mod is to show the postapocalyptic environment "from the artist's special point of view." So, maybe it's more casual than an action-oriented experience. Pros: —Environments are gorgeous to gander at, especially outside environments. I like the Battlefield vision. —Some textures looks impressive than the original models and textures I've seen —There are a couple of bosses that are creative but may take some time to get the patterns down. Cons: —Nothing is explained: you have no idea who you are, what is going on, where you came from, why you are here, and how you manage to enter this devastated wasteland by boat, go through a teleporter ion a roof, and somehow arrive and have an HQ with ammo, health, and briefing room. —It is very easy to get lost and no hints after the beginning section. —Lack of navigation may require trial and error jumps or actions, so saving is essential in this game. —One area requires you to pass through myriad lasers, and I may have done it to the point where it infuriated me, but not enough to use cheats toget by. —Pushing some buttons and levers located in the environment have no clear indication of what they perform unless shown by cameras. A script of a camera showing what each button does would have been helpful. —At certain times there is a bug where low gravity is activated, with the exception near the end of the game. Sometimes the AI can be disabled when loading a save game which may hinder the challenge. —Four hours max unless you can beat it under that time. —Switching weapons may become unusable with the middle mouse key, and at one point picking up an MP5 r endered it as a grenade. Overall, it was a good attempt to create a compelling storyline in the Half-Life 2 universe, but the execution was poor. Skip this title. "}

{"text" : "I have put off writing this review for some time, waiting for the updates to fix the bugs. While the updates did stream in eventually, having played much of the Deus Ex series, I found myself disappointed by the latest installment, as well as Square Enix's decision to nickel and dime players of the series. Let me start off by talking about the microtransactions in the game. Firstly, and especially, for a singleplayer game, you'd expect that the DLC items you purchased would be available on all playthroughs. Nope, Square Enix allows you to only use consumables (Praxis Kits, ammo, credits etc.,) once - similar to how some multiplayer games work - which is fairly ridiculous considering the fact that the price of the game and Season Pass aren't low. Add on to the fact that the game allows you to buy - yes, buy with real money - credits and Praxis kits - without having to earn them through your playthrough of the game. While I won't comment on the ethics of this decision, it is extremely offputting that the game shoves these in your face, moreover it being a singleplayer game. Before I forget, they ran an 'Augment your Pre-order' scheme prior to the release of the game encouraging players to preorder the game in exchange for 'rewards' that would unlock everytime the number of pre-orders hit a particular tier. This meant they had such 'rewards' ready, but were intentionally not offering them as part of the game, but as incentives to encourage pre-orders.The silver lining to this is that even without paying for the credits or Praxis kits, I was able to get through the game with a sizable inventory and enough Praxis for augmentations. Continuing on with the story - the game attempts to tell the story of a world that discriminates against Augs following the 'Aug incident'. While at times, the story was convincing, I found it lacking the immersion that was present in the previous games - especially emotionally. Sure, while the environment and the city hubs are much better in general, however, something about it just didn't sit right with me. Without having read the comics, I can safely say that many players will not be well-acquainted with the individuals introduced within the story - Alex, as an example. Unfortunately, the ending was just as lacklustre as that of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and was incredibly abrupt. After discussing the negatives, I still want to commend certain points in the game. Despite the story being lacklustre at best, the tidbits that are expected to be found in a Deus Ex game are plentiful and generally intriguing in this game. Michael McCann's compositions fits the overall themes of the game and added to the experience fairly well. Gameplay has been greatly improved from Human Revolution, especially if you enjoy waltzing in and shooting enemies in first person mode. I particularly like the fact that they have added new augmentations not present in HR - that increases the choices in terms of playstyle available to Jensen. The many side quests have also been fantastic - ranging in terms of the versatility of such quests, and the rewards you gain from them. With that said, as stoked as I was for the release of this game 5 years after Human Revolution, I am unable to recommend Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. While the game does impress with its improved environment and combat, for what it's worth, as a DX game I feel that the story-telling is an essential element of the game, and one that it cannot fall flat on. Unfortunately, that, and the whole saga with pre-ordering and microtransactions prevent me from recommending this game in good conscience. If you do decide to get the game, you will however, probably still have a lot of fun exploring the environment, completing the main story and side-quests. If you eventually enjoy the game, good for you. If you don't, I hope that this review would have helped in managing your expectations for the game. "}

{"text" : "Absolutely infuriating. Controls are gack, and not remappable. There's no way to lock the camera behind your little guy, so I'm constantly fighting with the mouse for perspective. There's no controller support! This game screams for controller support, yet it's not there. Your guy will constantly fall just off the edge of something, and despite your best efforts to turn him a bit to fix this, he'll inexplicably swing slightly in the wrong direction (maybe this is some kind of collision that I can't see), and now you'll be stuck with no way to fix things but to reset. There are corners that seem completely impossible, because the only way to make that turn is to have your guy floating in space behind the wheelbarrow. Additionally, I've had the wheelbarrow's wheel actually clip through the surface more than once, making me stuck in the middle of some object, forcing me to reset yet again. Also, a nitpicky point, but irritating nonetheless: when you go to graphic settings, and choose medium or high, nothing changes. If you come back to the setting, it'll still be set to "low." If there's no option to change the graphics, then it should be removed from the settings menu. There's potential for this to be a fun, even hilarious little indie game. But, as it stands with the fiddly, inaccurate controls, lack of controller support, and weird physics/clipping issues causing constant dropoff or getting stuck, it's just maddening instead of entertaining. I rage quit after about 10 minutes. Unless there are significant changes made to the controls and the way that the obstacles are laid out, I can't see myself coming back to it. 3/10 for a really good idea, but poorly implemented "}

I put it away two weeks after the release and took it out again last week because there are already some patches but there are no improvements. "}

{"text" : "Isometric pseudo Hack-and-Slash / Beat'em is disgustingly implemented with Unity. Low poly graphics, sinking textures, clumsy models, miserable animation and similar effects, poor and annoying voice acting. English stylized as Japanese characters is difficult to read. The whole game meaning of this Virtual Top product is to constantly press the left mouse button, which can be interrupted in order to improve the characteristics of the hero, pouring out equipment from the killed enemies. The inventory is implemented at a level similar to the entire "game": not informative, cluttered after 3 minutes, there is no way to return to the previous level of the inventory, as well as to clear it of unnecessary trash. But there is a color differentiation of the pants! There are even some skills, but there is no need to apply them. All three models of enemies are dying anyway. Everything is very very slow. And even slower. The process of the game demonstrated on the video is accelerated two times. If it were not for this annoying misunderstanding, then studying the "product" could have spent 5 minutes, and not 2-3 for which he manages to get bored, disappointed and discouraged. Compared to the rest of the Achievement Spammer, which is this craft with 5k achievements, the peer-reviewed misunderstanding from the outside looks even like a game. But here, too, the developer cheated and created only 5k identical-looking achievement icons. Fuuu be that way. The same, but with different skins, can be found under the name Morendar: Goblin Slayer and Cludbugz's Twisted Magic. A separate mention should be made of the price of this slag and cancer that kills Steam, in the amount of 200r / 9 $, which can be considered as an outright mockery of common sense (even taking into account a possible discount of 90%, even realizing that no one buys it in Steam).

Only the bugs, especially in the expert mission, reduce it a bit. But it's not something that makes it unplayable. Plus even better cut scenes. A great story! And transformations for every race.

{"text" : "I didn't want to apply a thumbs-down because this is a game that achieves a fair bit of what it set out to do, and is obviously a labour of love. Nice day/night changes, a peaceful feel to it, a chance to listen to MP3s in a fairly stress-free game, comfortable controls. It took me a while to get it set up, but I was soon chugging up hills at 15 mph. I think my main disappointment was to do with expectations. The blurb says: "dozens of cities to explore". I didn't expect 1-to-1 fidelity, but to me, explore means at least they would feel like cities, and be vaguely recognisable. Much as I'd have loved it to be like driving through Google Street View, I had already scaled back my expectations. I assumed maybe cities would only have a third of the roads, something like that. I wasn't prepared for reaching Cardiff, a city I know well, and discovering that it seemed to be two roads and a depot. Likewise with Swansea. Ouch. I'd persuaded my girlfriend that we might be able to drive from our hometown across Wales, then on to Europe, and eventually down the coast of Italy, perhaps finding the town where some of our family live. Wrong. The vast majority of places in each country are missing. A few cities will exists as just a couple of roads, nothing like what you'd expect from Saints Row/GTA/Sleeping Dogs. Don't get me wrong, that would be great but I understand why things have been scaled down - I just think it's deceptive not to make that clear from the sales blurb. If that had stated that there were 40 urban areas out of the many thousands, and that cities were scaled down 1,000 times, and that places with populations of below a million weren't included, I'd have at least had an idea of how far the game is from reality. For example, the UK alone has 69 cities (and many thousands of towns and villages) but ETS2 only has 18, each of which is a few roads. Cities mainly act as just blobs on a map, connecting points. A grand tour of Europe this is not - it's a patchwork quilt edged by invisible walls (well, you can see them, big Xs and chevrons floating in the air to stop you heading towards landmarks or B-roads or anything that isn't a motorway). The map of Italy seemed to cut off at the very edge - so technically Italy is included, but only as a few clumps of road in a teeny area. It seems disingenuous. Most European countries don't seem to be in the game. This is a disappointment only because of the misleading advertising. It seems you can listen to radio stations in game but I never got that to work, no matter how many URLs I added to a text document nested far down my hard drive hierarchy. No error messages - good luck if you aren't IT literate. Finally, I think I'd have got a bit more pleasure from it if I could have also had the option of driving around in a car rather than a truck. It's weird that the game simulates many things; as a company owner you probably have a car, but there is no option to go anywhere in it. I'd have thought a free drive mode would have been a nice addition for people like me, who don't want a racing game, just something more sedate, but the chance to explore the small part of Europe that has been included at a bit more of a zippy pace. Still, that's a suggestion, not a criticism. The main feeling I had was one of disappointment at the scale of the game. It may be hundreds of miles wide, but the detail is only inches deep, a surface impression that didn't really satisfy me. I can see why others might be happy with it. Maybe a more accurate blurb would have helped, rather than trying to sell the Earth. --- I can't comment on my own review's comments thread due to some error (thanks Steam), so here's my response to the comment by HaddockA, who said "You're seriously crazy to even think that such a game in 2016 could even exist... That's like having GTA V multiplied by a factor of 1,000.... you're seriously weird. ." My reply: "I probably am crazy but that's a separate issue. Having never played one of these games, but having used the free Google Street view which lets you do something similar, I don't see why it was crazy to imagine the game would map 33% of the roads, rather than 0.01% (or whatever the figure is). After all, it says "cities to explore". But you get there and there is nothing to explore. Just a few roads, one supermarket with an empty car park, and a background view you can't reach. If the blurb included what % of Europe's roads were included in the game then I'd be a fool to expect otherwise, but they don't include that information, thereby inviting inflated expectations." "}

At the end of the game, I was not particularly interested in games, so I played very famous hits, and then more often than not I did not even finish half of the score. So this newfangled feature at that time did not impress me in any way, in general, but there is nothing to say about the present. It's stuffy at the locations, there is a stupid goal and you go to it, the goals are the same from mission to mission to undermine, undermine and undermine again. Example: "Kappitan ZalupA, these damn anti-aircraft guns are interfering with our bombers, destroy them urgently!" "There is sir, there is destroy!" And even if in the next mission it will not be anti-aircraft guns, but a tank, a train, but the essence is the same. The weapon is plastic and it is completely unpleasant to shoot from it, that's something at the level of Metroshka. I don’t know it seemed to me or not, but don’t adjust the sensitivity of the mouse, but all the same, it’s twitchy. I did not particularly delve into the plot, but again this story is about the gallant American soldiers saving almost the whole world.

{"text" : ""Pay 39,95€ minimum to gain access to about 10% of content, while 60% of existing content most people found use of is wiped" *From Bungie* The Destiny Content Vault (DCV) is a new content model being implemented in Year 4 of Destiny 2.  To create a sustainable ecosystem where the world can continue to evolve in exciting ways,  and where we can update the game more quickly,  each year we will cycle some destination and activity content out of the game (and into the DCV)  to make room for new experiences. Unvaulting starts in D2 Year 4, with the Cosmodrome coming back, as well as its three Strikes and the return of the Vault of Glass Raid. Summary:  We remove most game content (Game modes, planets etc.) with very little to non to replace/compensate for. We are planning on bringing back previous vaults, but that might/will be behind a paywall. Prior to Beyond Light, the game was at its very peak, it has now literally hit rock bottom.  New sub class and Europa is nice but it just isn't anywhere near enough to compensate for both paying a minimum 39,95€ for a very short campaign (which is noticeably rushed, especially mid to near the end)  and very few new weapons & armours, also 1 new class (Stasis). Game feels extremely claustrophobic (very few planets to go to and do activities). I'm also not going to bother bringing up the whole sunsetting weapons and such, just look it up. They're working on "The Witch Queen" for 2021 & "LightFall" 2022. Until then, according to Bungie there will be barely any new content brought to the table.

{"text" : "This GRID 2019 is the reboot of the series. Well a reboot on a game of cars I do not understand the principle, but codemaster has promised heavy: better than the previous ones, rivalries between teams, .. of course of course. You can call it what you want but in the end the career comes down to a series of races / events with no real links, it's just stupid and mean races. Level content therefore we are entitled to 70 cars, 100 events and .... 13 circuits. Yes, 13. So we have Forza Motorsport 5 syndrome and you will quickly have PTSD from certain places since they come back ALL THE TIME. Also we start very poor and we do not have the means to pay for nice cars so we will have to do races and exploits (drifts, overtaking, etc.) which will give EXP and money. The first thing I was talking about was the rivalry between the teams. It was OVERSOLD by codemasters so worth it, huh? hahahaha, no. We can hire a teammate who will have such or such skills, will take as many% of the salary etc but in the end it is useless, in some races there is a rival driver, but beating him or not is useless. We also have a nemesis (often someone angry with us because we go too close) but that's no use. No, the only commands that can be done are at the D-pad and consist of: asking for the status of the rival (his place), asking for the status of the teammate, asking the teammate to attack, asking the teammate to defend. That's it that's all. Knowing that 80% of the time the teammate refuses to defend or attack, well, it's really useless in fact. We can change teammate and hire another, but given the pointlessness, you might as well say that you will just hire the one who takes the least%. On top of that there is literally 0 driver customization and car customization stops changing the color of the decals, plus you can't even choose a sponsor anymore. Other than that there is no career development like I said so absolutely no depth in "the rivalry between drivers and teams". nothing, nada. Let's start with the atmosphere since there is none. The few musics present are frankly generic and forgettable, the sounds are quite good (especially in view of the pilot) and bah ... That's it. Ah no the narrators. My god the narrators. There are Kirsten and Alex who are there all the time and are deadly boring besides being dubbed by amateurs. Most of the time they are just talking in the race to taunt you when you make a mistake, and your greatest pleasure will be to skip the introduction to the races just to hear Alex apologize for talking too much. Then graphically bah ... The cars are clean without being crazy, the destruction is quite good even if it seems that sometimes the cars are made of sugar. On the other hand the decorations are filthy, frankly. There are 13 tracks and most of them are ugly, the crowd characters have PlayStation 1-worthy heads, the trees are ultra low-res, and the buildings (eg in Barcelona) are textured in a hurry. It's so ugly that it's obvious when racing with the motion blur activated, frankly. How can we do so few circuits and not apply a minimum? No local multiplayer and otherwise we have races with 16 players and uh ... Well, the game would already have to be good enough for people to play it eh, so "yeah / 20". So we wait 5 years. Almost 5 years of teasing from an already adrift Codemaster, overselling his upcoming had and that's what they come out with. GRID is already half dead since GRID 2, never did anything better than GRID 1 and it's to release this stuff that they are reviving the license. Frankly if you want an arcade car game going everywhere except here it's not even worth it. "}

{"text" : "(It gives me a pain in the chest to analyze this dear game in a negative way, but come on) PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (or PUBG, literally translating, Battlefield of unknown players, but I believe that the name of the game is not that, I believe that PLAYERUNKNOWN'S is just to publicize the game by the pseudonym of the creator of the game, or something, it's like in Ubisoft games with the title Tom Clancy's in my opinion) it is a first and third person shooter that adopts the Battle Royale game mode, consists of a massive number of players jumping on an open map and looking for equipment to survive and kill, the map will reduce as time passes by a kind of deadly barrier or something, the last alive wins, simple! The game was and still is a total fever, as it managed to revive this highly acclaimed type of game, Battle Royale, extremely fun and challenging! Okay, but why the negative analysis? Well ... Let's go part. First and most important of all, optimization, PUBG has already been "officially launched" and still has an extremely nutty optimization, I didn't even get 60fps in many moments of gameplay, which bothered me a lot for a game that doesn't have such heavy graphics ... The funny thing is that throughout this year of development, instead of trying to develop the optimization, they simply added more systems, etc., like scaling, a new map, skins, which for me is a shame because all this time expense could very well be used to make the game at least playable for the public ... Another great detail is the massive amount of bugs and connection problems, seriously, I’ve never seen a game this bad, I barely took 2 steps and it seems that I didn't walk, among other problems !!! Summary: PUBG ended up being taken too far by the hype and couldn't handle this massive amount of players and was poorly managed in its production, in addition to having a completely early and poorly made release, the game was supposed to have everything to be the best game of the year!!! But unfortunately it was not the case, maybe they will learn from the mistakes and update the game correctly to give a well done and fluid experience for the players, but until then, it will take a long time ... So for now, I do not recommend buying this game!!! PS: I am open to feedback, and if you find any error in this analysis, comment what it was. "}

{"text" : "First of all most people review this game and talk about the "bad controls". The controls are a bit crazy at first, but once you rebind them / get used to them it's an alright game. That's not what makes me not recommend this game. I found some event issues in game that ruins your game play. I was moving along and found a gun store event. The store locked me in, I went to bat and smashed in infected brains all over the place. When it was complete it said "loot the store" so I did. It said it was complete. So I moved forward heading towards the Army Base (end game area). I found another event and it started...but...then it said "Loot the gun store"...but...I already did. Why are you making me go back to the gun store when I am here at this new event that is a supply drop? Run back across the map 0.5 miles or more to try to "loot the gun store" and well let's just say it was bugged and prevented more events from working. I lost days of progress trying to back track to "fix" the gun store and it wouldn't work. So I couldn't do events anymore. It ruined my play through and made me request a refund. Is it "that bad"...yes and no, but mostly yes. You see you can loot houses for good loot, but the events are where the really nice drops are. As the infected strength increases you need better weapons, armor, backpacks and schematics to be able to make things to kill the infected. With the events being broken that prevented me from being able to get better loot. With me not being able to get better loot I was unable to take on the harder levels of infected unless I was blessed enough to find great weapons and armor in safes. So I spent even more time searching houses instead of moving towards the end game goal which causes some unnecessary grinding. Good sound effects Pretty good music Interesting concept of a game Decent looting system, but too low of % chance to get good items from houses Good healing system that's simple and effective Good night time survival idea of having to reinforce / barricade where you are against "super" infected "hunters" Broken event system Broken event system Broken event system...get the picture here? If you get this bug it ruins your chances of getting good loot you NEED to survive later on Sometimes your guns don't hit targets even if you're aiming right on/at enemies Control system can be quirky at first Respawn issues at times that can bug out and put you into walls or things Too rare of a % chance to find schematics outside of events and if events are broken...you're in big doodoo Molotovs are practically worthless. Zeds have to stand in fire, they don't stay on fire and they do more damage to your own barricades than they do enemies so early game thrown weapons are pointless. Certain weapons are lackluster and worthless in value as the ammo cost is too high to kill or the % chance of finding the ammo you need, if NOT playing the Looter character, is way too low and you'll end up using melee attacks a lot. Only a few weapons are TRULY worthwhile and you can get bored with the grind of it. Potential to be such a great game, but these bugs ruin the play experience and make it not fun at all. I would wait until they fix / repair these issues and then perhaps the game will be more fun. Until then I would wait as it's not worth it on sale because you'll only get so far and be "stuck" with no good loot and you'll regret wasting your time. I REALLY wanted to like this game. It looked SO fun, but I've never been more disappointed in a game recently than this. It was a truly devastating experience. "}

{"text" : "From Wikipedia: The request "Amygdala" is redirected here. The amygdala, amygdala (lat.corpus amygdaloideum) is a characteristic area of ​​the brain, shaped like an amygdala, located inside the temporal lobe (Lobus temporalis) of the brain. The amygdala plays a key role in the formation of emotions and is part of the limbic system. It is believed that in humans and other animals, this subcortical brain structure is involved in the formation of both negative (fear) and positive emotions (pleasure). Its size is positively correlated with aggressive behavior. Conditions such as anxiety, autism, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and phobias are thought to be associated with abnormal functioning of the amygdala. Never buy this slag if you do not want to reduce the size of this very amygdala. Be prepared for the fact that a blue screen of death may appear during the game, I do not know what the developers have stirred up there. The game itself is dull and boring, completely uninformative, moreover, with a buggy control. We jump with some kind of amoeba with a third eye on the platforms hanging in the air and collect crystals. Along the way, we meet "monsters" generated by sick imagination and crooked hands of the artist. Bottom line: 1% of the developer's amygdala size from the normal 100%. "}

Exhibiting the game is one of those things. There is no menu or ESC for this but only stall with Alt + F4. The music isn't annoying, but I don't think it fits the game. Unfortunately the F12 screenshot function stopped working at some point. Would have liked to have made some screenshots for me.

{"text" : "Well, finally, despite the difficulties, I interrogated this singleplayer skin store. I went with all the DLS and wanted to write a review in full. In general, this game is almost a complete copy of the gameplay features from the Origins (who would have thought, the game was ready at the time of the Origins release and was developed just kicked a year). But what can we say, it was like a hodgepodge of gameplay features of other games, and it remains. However, the battle still got better, thanks to the skills from the spear fragments on the back. However, since the Origins, fighting an assassin has become something boring for me. Previously, it was possible to kill the enemy with 2-3 blows, or start a series of blows, which made combat not boring and rather fast. But this is an RPG game because a matter of taste. The animations still look pretty sharp and not realistic, and up the mountain Alexios (I know that Cassandra is canon, but she is weird and was made to please the femmes, so fuck her like yy) crawls up the mountain on a flat surface. Yes, it would be difficult to make protrusions by hand for each mountain, but after all, the developers had a whole year and a program that itself exhibited protrusions in cities from the second part. Why was it impossible to finalize it and spend an extra year on finishing up parkour with animations, and not on drawing fucking skins for money? But in general, if you do not pay attention to this, it becomes even comfortable to play. I can't really say about the plot. In terms of an assassin, he is none, because neither one nor the other in the game, only their pitiful likeness. But he is not bad in principle and can be played. A kind of Witcher 3 on ultra minimal and wretched novels. However, it is full of inconsistencies and breaking lore too. I will now begin to smear him for holes, because the "smart guys" will come running and accuse me of patronizing one fairly well-known Swede in the fandom. However, I give a shit and I want to talk about a couple of inconsistencies right away. First, why the hell are we given the choice between Alexios and Kassandra? The game is COMPLETELY the same for them. This is not possible within the framework of logic, because each of them has their own memories. If Cassandra is a canon, then based on logic and choosing Alexios, we should play for, but no, smart yubi think that two different people can have the same story. Okay, I know what they will say to me now, "Well, only the player sees all the dialog boxes, in the game itself neither Layla nor the yrs see them. Okay, this would be an explanation if not for one" but ". At the beginning of the game, Victoria asks whom we want to choose, which means that nothing should have changed in the game itself. Okay, we have decided on the choice of the Persian. Now I want to talk about the immobility of the spear. Sorry, but you can find out that this spear cannot? In the game, it is an ideal weapon, After all, it is capable of simply impossible things. Okay, invisibility, which can be explained, but what about the poisoning and ignition of weapons / arrows? Many type say that he sets them on fire and ignites them, but in the game itself it is clearly visible that this is done with a spear. about jumping from any height? How does a piece of a spear help gg not turn into mince when falling from a simply colossal height? And these teleportations from enemy to enemy from cover? (which was stolen from the last game about batman) .Many people say that gg just "runs up " fast. Yeah, then why the hell can he run across 20-meter canyons? About the features of the staff / spear from the DLS about Atlantis, I generally won't say anything. This is a clear rape of the particle lore that came from the second part. Now a few words about the dls. The first DLS is pretty good and I even liked it, but .... it's not a DLS, but a cut out part of the story campaign. Seriously, the ending of the first DLS should be the ending of the original game and I'm sure it was originally. I can't say for sure about the second DLS. I liked the water, but ... again, this DLS turns the game into running around with weapons glowing like lightsabers. If in Origins the sword from Final Fantasy was added as a response from the developers to the event with the assassins in the finale, then these weapons look simply inappropriate. And as I said above, the capabilities of the staff ... are impossible within the old lore about artifacts. In general, these are good dls, which can not be taken seriously. From the atmosphere of Ancient Greece, I can say that everything is very good. Yubis know how to design cards and recreate the atmosphere of the era, however, indulging "minorities" kills their own games. As a result, the game can be judged controversially. If you do not look that the title has "Assassin's Creed", then you can play. After all, this game was not originally part of the assassin's universe and was simply dragged into it roughly. Developers are not to blame for the fact that their original idea was not calculated as part of a new game in the series. But still, this game is not bad for me. Somewhere 6 out of 10 pulls. The game came out average, so I recommend buying at discretion. "}

{"text" : "Full Review - The New Adventures of the Immortal Assassin is about the same puzzle as the aforementioned Slayaway Camp. Jason moves around the neighborhood like a rook in chess - strictly in a straight line - so you have to maneuver among the various elements of the level to get to all the victims, bypass the police and special forces, and kill the last girl (or boy). Or use various objects to lure the unfortunate to the right place. The whole thing is interspersed with hilarious inserts, in which the killer, for example, brutally pierces the victims with kettles and dumbbells, hammers them into the ground, cuts them into pieces and generally does not deny himself anything. And at the beginning and at the end of each story episode, consisting of exactly 13 levels, absolutely wonderful videos with stupid inhabitants, busy with their own affairs and not noticing the impending threat, await. Despite the fact that Friday the 13th: Killer Puzzle is obviously a comedy game (by the way, it allows you to turn off the blood in "child mode"), puzzles in it can sometimes be confusing. It often happens that you snap like nuts for almost a dozen problems, and then you get stuck in the next one for a long time. However, the severed head of Pamela Voorhees, Jason's mother, who loves her dead psychopathic son, is always ready to help. If you don't know how to get through the next tricky level, just ask her for a solution. There seem to be no penalties for this. Each successful massacre adds a dose of bloodlust to you. And when you have collected enough, you will get a new level - and with it natural lootbox. Who can bestow new amazing weapons - like a fish, a marble bust or a skeleton arm. True, repetitions cannot be avoided, but every three pieces of junk can be exchanged for a new box with a surprise. It's no surprise that the new Friday the 13th game operates according to the laws of typical mobile games - it was first released on Android and iOS devices. Here you will find daily challenges with a series of 13 missions, and an endless mode, which is called "Mortal Marathon" here. And a completely insane monetization system: the first episode (of course, of 13 levels) can be completed for free, and for each subsequent episode they will ask for 61 rubles. As for optional skins for Jason, they will require 30 rubles. If you want to assemble a complete set, then you will have to pay 965 rubles. - a totally insane price for an indie puzzle game. If it were not for the strange distribution model of Friday the 13th: Killer Puzzle, which the version for personal computers inherited from portable platforms, then we would have an exemplary puzzle - sometimes difficult, but with intuitive mechanics and direct, but really good humor. From real fans of the horror cycle to real fans behind monitors. But the developers for some reason decided to cut the available content into tiny portions - one cannot even say that they offer some kind of "base" for free. Therefore, I cannot recommend the game without reservation. If you want to get hooked on the DLC or are ready to ditch here and now for a full set of puzzles for almost 1000 rubles, then you should know: the game is really good and licked to shine. But if you were not so impressed with Slayaway Camp to spend energy on fighting an inadequate monetization system, then walk by - you will not lose anything. P.S .: Review by press copy, which - all of a sudden! - also a stump. "}

{"text" : "Simulation of being cancer. The logic of the game is actually very nice. A maniacal killer and 4 survivors trying to get rid of him. They said come and experience cliché horror movies for yourself. They also said that it is beautiful, but in practice it is not so. First I want to talk about the beautiful aspects of the game, and then why I hate it. + It gets really nervous when you just start the game. As you get used to the environment, atmosphere and sounds over time, that tension goes away, of course, but the game I said is extremely successful in stretching you. + Extremely enjoyable to play with your friends. It doesn't matter whether you enter full survivor or four of you survive, one of you is killer. Playing with your friends is extremely enjoyable. If you play with your sweetheart, this pleasure becomes even more multiplied. (You can even be an artist when you save your lover from the hook: d) + The mechanics of the game are extremely simple but very enjoyable. + Each clay in the game has its own special power. Besides, every killer and survivor has perks. There is an incredible amount of perk in the game and it is possible to build many different builds with them. Character customization is very good. + You do not remain aimless in the game with challanges and events. When you do these, you both earn more points and increase the action dosage in the game. For example, there are challanges such as blind twice while running from the killer. It makes the game more enjoyable. + The game gives you the atmosphere of cliché horror movies well. You seriously feel like the characters in those movies. These are all good aspects of the game. Don't get me wrong, the game is really cool, but here they are just crushed under the minuses I will list now. - It can enter incredible lag in the game. When my ping is extremely low, it can intermittently enter this game while experiencing 0 lag in other games. The killer is chasing you, you think you've run away. Hop 2 3 seconds ago you fell where you thought you passed, you are lying on the ground. Space check is coming while doing the generator. You have a sound and you are pressing in the right place, but it explodes because lag enters. It's a seriously scary situation. - How many years of game, there are very old maps. You can still hit the ground somewhere. It's like a joke. You are stuck, you cannot move. Napsan is not happening and you are waiting hopelessly. After the killer sees you and gets an easy hit. - Camper and tunnel killers. Very cute producers argue that this is a strategy, but you forgive it, but let me put it in that strategy. When someone falls on the ground and hangs on a hook and is camped by the killer, he dies. Even if you go and grab it off the hook, the killer chases after that man, classic camper head. And the guy can't play the game just because of a stupid camper, and the rank is going down for a shitty reason. As these producers say, let's build a generator while there is a camper and run away. So what is the sin of being hung on the hook? Then if someone is camping, the man on the hook should not lose points. This is a detail that is seriously stupid and detracts from the game. - Survivors who travel around and do nothing. It is possible to come across malefactors who run around idly, enter the closet, crouch right and left and do nothing in the game. This is another factor that makes the game fun. While your advantage as Survivors is your number, you start missing because of the idiots who do this. One step further is the goods that commit suicide when op clays arrive. Lan is already more likely to die while surviving in this game than to escape. This is the logic with which the game is built. Why are you leaving now? If even one person on the team is going to run away, help that escape. Maybe you'll be the one who escaped? Also, when someone hangs, it is another shit that everyone is running around and trying to save that person. Aga, do they wear medals when everyone leaves? Follow the yellow silhouettes. If someone is close or someone is leaving, continue the generator or search for a generator. Why are you wasting time? These minus details are seriously off the game. But if you play clays, you play very comfortably. At least your loss is due to your own fault. But I guess the producers don't care much about playing survivor because of the situations I mentioned. Am I quitting the game despite all this swearing? No, one more last match (Endless loop amk) "}

{"text" : "This review contains spoilers. I liked Missed Messages, so I wanted to like this one too. The art is beautiful as usual. It's an extremely short game having gotten one proper ending in <20 minutes.

One unexpected thing that I did not enjoy and genuinely did not think to see in the game was the   I feel as though that should have been mentioned somewhere in the game description or images. Personally, I did not enjoy that story addition as well as the related ending. It left a bitter taste in my mouth as I wasn't looking to  The story is sweet, but lacks SO much depth. With how quickly the story is paced, there is no time to really form an emotional connection to the characters. I was expecting something so much different when it came to the endings. Into the second 'chapter' iirc, I expected them to have some sort of differences or anything beyond being cookie cutter perfect matches when having what's supposed to be that chapter's emotional conversation. It feels more like the game's priorities lie in how many endings it can have and just pretend to be complex rather than how diverse can the story be and have an actual good ending where you feel accomplished.  I expected there to be endings where they break up in terms of being hurt or to be one with them realising how different they were when discussing their dreams. Their relationship felt so rushed, there had to be something that they'd get hurt on right? I guess not.    I really wanted to like this game. Genuinely. But it's so generic and so empty. 5 endings, but it was just the same 2 endings but different places. This game is good at a face value. Beautiful art and a cutesy WLW story but that's all it is.  Try to sympathise and understand the characters and you won't get very far. TLDR; Story is empty, game is honestly about 20 minutes, and not really worth it unless you want an extremely short-lived meh experience. "}

Even with daily missions the gold is extremely underwhelming when you compare the free to play systems to other card games such as Legends of Runeterra, Hearthstone, and Magic the Gathering Arena.

{"text" : "Well, a zombie game, which is NOT a survivial or an action game. It is an undercover rig. The game consists of the journey of our protagonist to save his friends and find his family. The argument is over. More classic impossible but it works, it is realistic, it is what is expected in an apocalyptic world and it is well managed. In this deadlight, we always move to the right, it is a side scrolling game, but represented in 3 dimensions, it is curious to see but it seemed strange to me at first, when you get used to it, the truth is quite funny. As I say, it is actually a platform, you have to go around the different difficulties of the road with success, jumping, climbing and running. From time to time you will hit a zombie with an ax, and a couple of times if you want to, you will hit a shot. On a couple of occasions you'll swell to shoot It may seem scary ... a zombie game that doesn't have much action, that is focused on platforms ... poof that poops right? No, I think they have handled it well. It gives the feeling that the character is trying to evade and flee from the zombies, instead of rambo against them. I think that's exactly the word that would define the game: evasion. The protagonist is all the time avoiding the dangers of the dead, jumps over them, climbs to leave them behind, climbs a cable ... It's a short game really, 4 hours says steam. Mm, subtract cinematics and the reading of the newspaper ... Although it has secrets and collectibles, and you can spend more time on it. For me the most interesting was the protagonist's diary. Lots of pages that tell about pre-game events, I found it quite interesting, and it screwed me that I didn't have some pages of the collectibles. Point against? The control is HORRIBLE. That clear, fucking control shit, in every way. Above the pointing is 3 times horrible. The fucking control was very heavy for me (without command, with keyboard). We can also put as a point against that the second part of the game (there are 3 chapters) can be more pain in the ass, but that is already up to each one. Anyway, the game is quite well designed, it is entertaining, the atmosphere is well achieved, I do not see as bad that it focuses on the platforms because they take them well ... but it offers little. Little in general, an argument that is not enough, some platforms that are simple (if you can control it of course because it works), an action that is also little ... it seems more like a long demo, or a beta game. More and better is what you need. And improve the fucking control. "}

The dark shape that they chose to make the game does not contribute at all, frustrates the player not knowing that there is a wall locking you or not knowing where to go because the flashlight is poorly made and the lighter even more, it goes out of walking fast and badly illuminates. Games like Outlast and Amnesia justify the pitch of not seeing anything, they made sense of it and here is just something badly used and futile applied from start to finish. it hides from the player the details of the scenarios, the way of the death of the torn bodies and the air of "ornament" of the terror is overshadowed. A positive point was the audio and the sounds of the creatures and the fear sometimes, but I think this is not enough to save a game. Particularly it is my disappointment of the games in 2020, I know he is indie and small !! But I created a certain expectation to take good screenshots of him and to have enjoyed the game better.

At first, the puzzles are simple, but over time, you need to prevent emoticons from falling off the screen, to prevent falling into an insurmountable trap, to prevent falling on the red annihilation curve, to draw outside the grid. Upon collision, the background always changes to the same pink image with a flower. Drawing is inconvenient. The line being drawn is too thick, breaks off on contact with surfaces or emoticons. The game constantly freezes when trying to process physics. I constantly had the thought that the game was secretly mining cryptocurrency, loading the processor and video card by about 30%.

{"text" : "●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬●  Developer: Creative Assembly ×°×★Summary Review★×°× Overall Rating: ★★☆☆☆ [2/5] Story: ★★☆☆☆ Gameplay: ★☆☆☆☆ Sound: ★★★☆☆ ●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬● ★OVERALL★ Alien: Isolation teaches us that you can't trust the majority's opinion. This game has been praised to high hell, but I found it severely disappointing. I thought I was buying a game about  Aliens, but what I got was a half-baked stealth/walking simulator. After just two hours, I couldn't take it anymore. It made me want to scream at the sheer amount of mediocrity assaulting my eyeballs. Don't buy it! ★STORY★ It's like they spent an afternoon developing the story for this game at a pizza hut. You're playing Ripley's estranged daughter. Your motivation is the promise of finding your mother that's been missing for years. That's about it. Yep. That's your motivation for risking your life on a broken ass space station with a psychotic monster on-board. Everyone is dead or dying or killing each other. Does this make you want to stop, turn around, and get the hell out of there? Nooope. ★GAMEPLAY★ Omg the gameplay is just the worst. Most of my time was spent wandering empty halls wonder where the ♥♥♥♥ I was supposed to go, because the waypoint system is complete garbage. Most of the time, I was given an objective with no clue where to go or how to achieve it. I've never had to resort to Youtube guides within the first hour of a game before. Everything is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dark that you can't see anything, even with the gamma turned up to max. You can't jump and are often blocked by TINY BOXES, fallen pipes, or sealed doors that serve as a barrier to keep you from exploring too far, so there's literally NO exploration to this game. In one instance, instead of hopping over a knee-high barrier, you're forced to climb through a fallen vent that has collapsed onto said barrier to get past it. I mean, come on. That's just awful. Once you pull out your flare, there's no way to put it back. If you accidently push the X button, oops! There goes your last flare. Too bad, so sad. Guess you'll have to use your flashlight that gobbles up batteries so fast it only lasts a few minutes. ★SOUND & MUSIC★ The production value of the music and sound effects are truly the only saving grace of this game. It's really top notch. But unfortunately, it's not enough to save the game. ★BUGS & BOTHERS★ It really bothers me that this game is being sold as a cutting-edge graphics engine that will knock your socks off. Well, that's a lie. The use of lens flare and really, really, REALLY dark gamma correction is used to cover up the flaws like a makeup on a cheap hooker. Once the cutscenes (of which are too frequent for my tastes) take over the screen, you get a good look at how bad the graphics really are. "}

The new method of cheating which the kiddies nowadays prefer is to transform everyone into burning toilets or sticking fire hydrants onto everyones butt so they cant walk or move or even open their phone/menu to start a gamemode to escape from this lobby. The only solution is to search a new lobby but the next surprise already awaits you there. Things like these happen in almost every lobby with a playercount above 20 .

CIV VI is badly optimized when running in full glory,which is the way it meant to be played. If my high-end PC can barely handle this and i get my CPU temps rising to hell,then the medium/average/casual player will play this on medium settings and get even worse graphics/gameplay. So even if you find the art style "appealing" and you dont care about the UI,you still have to suffer the terrible utter annoying voice acting! Seriously,who the f**k is responsible for this? This game comes from a historic franchise and is hyped as an AAA video game,but in reality it looks worse than its predesessor,plays worse than CIV V and it doesnt live the hype at all.  No wonder why it took  18months,plus sales/humble bundle to reach CIV V in users online(Stats tab on Steam).

Anti-consumer at the next level, bravo id, bravo Bethesda! Today, I finish Eternal campaign so I think this is the time to write my serious review for it. You will like: If you like DOOM 2016, you gonna like Eternal, too. Gunplay, soundtrack, violent. Things that make DOOM we know and love still there. Gameplay mechanic is the same with '16. Kill demons to get health, armor, ammo. Watch some cutscene to know what purpose of thing you are doing, then move to another location to repeat the cycle. Simple, but enjoyable. You will hate/dislike: This time, you gonna use your brain more than when you play '16. Ammo system is broken, more enemy, they also stronger, aggressive than ever before but you have less ammo. Some of them sometime will pi$$ you up as they become annoying AF especially on Ultra-Violent or higher. Perhaps they want to make the game more challenge but some people just wanna have some fun, not try hard or go pro all the time. They should make it dedicated to higher difficulty like Nighmare, Ultra-Nightmare and leave alone easier. Secondly, about new multiplayer mode called BATTLEMODE. It's not traditional, Quake-like Deadmatch/Team Deadmatch as DOOM'16. This time, you play like Tom and Jerry. 1 fully-loaded Slayer vs 2 demons. Hunt or be hunted depend on yourself. Myself doesn't enjoy it like campaign, only play it to get some XP to earn some cosmetic item and complete Milestones/Achievements. The game have quite number of technical bug. Crash, won't lauch, milestone doesn't mark as completed despite you already did, cosmetic skill doesn't show up properly, etc. I got 2 times it suddenly exit without any pop-up error while playing, and many time the game auto change my Aspect Ration and Resolution forced me to manual delete it config file in order to get it back to normal. Not sure why, but I used to lost entirely progression while atempt to change them back as I want in other 2 id Tech base game (DOOM'16 and Wolfenstein II). So BEWARE!!! They also forced us to use Slayer Club account for online, customization stuffs, but what point of it when they can't make their own server work correctly. Bethesda server is crap!!! The lack of communication make whole situation more complicated. I do understand that current pandemic forced developer to work from home or suspend their work but some post/announcement on forum, social media isn't that hard to do. Right? They should focus on this instead of promo Battlemode crap. Conclusion: At the moment, I can not recommend this game. Don't get me wrong, it is fantastic game, but being plague by many technical issue, which make thing isn't fun anymore. I'll update my review later base on how dev and publisher hand these problem.

{"text" : "I don't normally play point & click's but decided to try this one due to a bit more spare time on my hands recently, the fact that it was included in a bundle and it looked like it had a unique graphical style. At points during the five hours or so I spent with the game it had moments that could've converted me to the genre.  The game had some scenes that followed logic and there were a couple of puzzles that gave a degree of satisfaction to solve.  Sadly, the majority of puzzles were convoluted and followed little logic.  The last chapters were the ones that carried the most guilt.  I found myself just wandering around, finding a new item and then having to revisit every object and NPC to see if the new item would interact with it to further my progress.  In the end I had to regrettably resort to a walkthrough, checking the other reviews I seem to be not alone with this. The overall experience felt cumbersome and the story had no real depth.  If the game was any longer than it was I wouldn't have persevered to the end (even though I used a guide). The game is not a complete travesty and may appeal to fans of the genre?  It's not put me off enough to not try another point & click, but I won't be recommending Truberbrook in a hurry. "}
{"text" : "If you like loading simulators then this game is for you. Why you ask? Because you will spend 90% of the game having to wait for something to load. It isn't that there are long but that there are to many loading screens in this game and it really got to me, to a point of not enjoying the game. Just as an example and small spoiler in the game there is a part where you can loot every house without the risk of getting caught but because i would have to deal with the crazy amount of loading screen i decided not to do any of that. Another example is you have a household (this is not a spoiler since you see the button from the beginning of the game) and for you to heal, yu have to pass THREE loading screen. THREE. That for me is so much. Another bad part is the story, in my opinion, nothing interesting happens until the actual end of the story and even the end was meh. The side stories were very boring and fetching quests.  My companions weren't very interesting and after doing their ONE quest, you had nothing to talk about with them. The fact you don't receive any experience after a combat seemed like a really weird mechanic since i made me ask why do they have a combat system in place if you don't get rewarded by using it. But yes i enjoyed the combat very much and probably was the only good thing in this game. While i was plying i had on the option to hear the commentary from the development team and almost in all the places one of them said "They didn't have time" or "They almost didn't put it" or "They had to change it at the last minute" and hearing to them say that it explains why this game is so bland, they didn't have time to do anything. But then i also makes me question why it was released if it wasn't finished the way they wanted to. I also have to add that i only completed this game because i hear everyone saying it's an amazing game and i wanted to see for myself if it's true and sadly i was very disappointed.

{"text" : "I was really looking forward to it as a sequel to the Civilization series, but maybe I was expecting it a little too much. For the time being, I went around and wondered if it would be okay for now. Usability: The UI is the opposite of Civ5 in many parts. It may seem strange at first, but you will soon get used to it. Personally, I was interested in the optional "scroll when the mouse comes to the edge" function. I enabled it because it was an operation I was used to in Civ5, but I felt that the operability of this was very bad. Since the edge is not the edge of the screen but the edge of the map, the range to be judged is narrow, and all the icons at the edge of the screen are installed within that range, so the map scrolls every time you click. It was very stressful that I couldn't see the place I wanted to see immediately and the screen moved without permission. Graphics: Aside from cartoon-style likes and dislikes, it's very beautiful. The fog of war has disappeared, and the expression has changed to something like an old map. This is very good in itself, but even if it was discovered once, the area outside the unit's field of view turned brown, making it difficult to see the difference between undiscovered and undiscovered. Music: The OP theme is great. BGM in the game has also changed with the times like Civ4. However, even though it is during the war, there are some parts that are a little lacking in excitement, such as a cheerful BGM and a long period of silence. Domestic affairs: I have the impression that it is more complicated than Civ5. The heritage will also use 1 hex, and depending on the building, the place where it can be built is limited, making it easier to specialize in the city (it may be better to say that it is inevitably forced to specialize). If I didn't think about it and plan the city, I started to cry later. War: The specifications are such that hate from AI is so easy to accumulate that everyone hates you even though you are not doing anything. They are so warlike that a two-front war is the norm, even at the lowest difficulty levels. At the moment, I can't request a declaration of war (I'm wondering if Civ5 has undertaken the war with just one resource), so there is no way to escape the war. The operability of the battle itself is not much different from Civ5, but as the times go by, you will be able to stack units. It's only been two days since it was released, and I think there will be a lot of changes due to DLC and patches, so I can't recommend it to Civ5 users, especially for now. This is my favorite Civ series, so I'm looking forward to it in the future. "}

Maybee it is not significantly for you, and you want play this game, but i can tell only one thing: if you liked first and second part of Sacred - don't play this game. It is not our favorite Sacred. Only new game with "history" of Sacred named "Sacred 3". "}

As you go through the game you do feel like your stuck as a computer with your interfaces while also allowing you to select specific things to say about when the time is right. When you connect to a camera or bump your little sphere ball the game reacts by making your screen re-adjust to what has happened through the bump/being connected to. There's a few puzzles to deal with that once you get used to the controls of using them then you find them a nice little point to interact and have some fun although failing the ones that you get to fail a limited amount of times doesn't change much in the grand-scheme of things it seems. It's a badly done PC port in terms of controls as there are a few points where I changed the default controls due to the awkwardness of them (Z and X I think were to control up and down while using WASD to move). Additionally there were controls that I could not change like looking around in camera view had to be done via WASD and during a one off interaction where you had to use WASD to input.....I think it was an 12 digit number combination said very quickly with the subtitles sticking around for a very short period. Thankfully the game did move on after the third go around...anyway that is my number 1 complaint. Guiding starts off nicely when you get a bit lost and ask for the last command to be repeated however as you progress you do end up with wondering where you are meant to do this and that. This is especially confusing when your put far away from the objective or into a sphere when it is a camera only objective and asking for the command to be repeated doesn't give any further help after asked multiple times. Lighting in the game all round fits the atmosphere very well until the end where you are give one last chance to go around and look for anything you might have missed which is very hard to do when the lighting is a dark red or has a very dim light on in the room. There is very little interactivity as a game can be done as I felt like I was pressing buttons once in a while to progress instead of working forward which I did gain a bit of towards the end. However when I wanted to have some station alerts dealt with after the small window was given to do so, I wasn't allowed to say about them. I feel the same thing about cutscenes as well when they have to end first for me to wait a few seconds for the game to then give the prompt to reply. So if you like stuff like Beyond Two Souls or Heavy Rain gameplay then it shouldn't bug you like it did for me. Continuity as when you go for your first spacewalk you get a chance to look around the surrounding area and you see the blackness and    Mainly due to the controls I give this 3-4/10 which if they were fixed up to be better then I would then recommend the game though it being a 5/10 for the 5 hours of playtime I put in (I do feel that I could squish it down to 2 hours if I replayed it). They really bugged me in combination with the guiding getting worse when I asked for assistance which ended up being   at the end. However the visuals with the audio and the fact your in space were simulated well to put yourself into the fact that your computer helping your crew was very nice and relaxing with the twists that came along. For the price I got it where it was 50% off I would say that it is a good purchase for those interested in light puzzlers with a heavy focus on railroading you along with playing it through just once.

{"text" : "Is S. T. R. E. T. C. H. really so addictive as it's promoted? Well, we're expecting a "simple and hardcore top down flight shooter". Let's see what they did here. First of all, there are only a few achievements - five of them to be more precise, and they are related to in-game points. 200 points nets you the rarest achievement. How much does it take? Five minutes of play. Probably less. If you are looking for easy achievements, this game can be literally completed within five minutes. The game itself runs windowed on Unity, and it features no sound/soundtrack/music/effects AT ALL. No tutorial of any kind is given - there are no levels or anything else. You are just put into the middle of the action. And yeah, the game is a retro top down shooter - you command some kind of airship (a jpeg image taken from Google probably) with enemy planes and spaceships coming and firing at you. You have an autofire and.. there's nothing else. Upgrades? No (almost). Boost, bombs, anything else? Nothing. WASD to move and nothing else, it shoots the basic fire automatically. Sometimes it will double by getting some items. The hitboxes are total crap, meaning that you'll be likely killed even if you're far from the enemies. Oh, and ZERO life bar too. You touch one "thing" (the enemies basically shoot white dots) and you're automatically at the first screen. So as I said, it takes five minute to shoot the enemies and get to 200. You get points only by shooting them, not even by taking them down. And the game offers nothing else. No bosses, little upgrades of no value, anything interesting. 5 minutes if you want all the achievements but I can't recommend this game. "}

{"text" : "Mordhau, A game of extreme aggravation and torment. When it comes to sword play games there is nothing better than this game especially in the medieval genre, wonderful customization and creativity, beautiful graphics, and awesome sound design. But it's player base and mechanics can get a bit heavy, players come and go with their toxicity but when it's there, man is it there. Followed by it's very heavy control scheme taking about half your keyboard and very awkward timing of swings and opponent reading, this game is the king of hard to learn, AND hard to master all at once. Vets coming from chivalry make this game a big up hill battle to climb when it comes to catching up, so do not expect this game to be a pick up and play kind of game, time and time again you will have your ass handed to on a silver platter until you get some form of understanding on how to defend yourself, but it's up to you when you learn it, sadly in this game you can't have everything taught to you in one night, you have to learn by playing countless of hours just to get somewhat efficient at dueling, and never mind fighting crowds of people. The learning curve is so deep you are gonna be scratching your head on what you did wrong half the time because it is not completely obvious of your mistakes, you are just gonna have to guess until you find the right one, which can take a day, or a year. Every attack is pretty much bindable but you may not have enough fingers or mental capacity to do all 6 directional swings and stabs, so I recommend using the 240 feature to do the swap work but it can be a bit unreliable at times, which is why I suggest using the 3rd person view for more spatial awareness as the swings depend on mouse movement which can make you disoriented in 1st person. The hitbox is super accurate and I mean crazy accurate, so it does not take much to miss an attack. (ping can play apart tho) All an all the game is very fun and a nice pass time, but the very hard mechanics and experienced players may ruin the enjoyment of the climb making you want to quit early, But unless you enjoy a challenge and want to over come this mountain go ahead and give it a shot. 7/10 and maybe even an 8 if the parry system was not so annoying and counted for everything on survival, I miss games using block as a form a defense and not just a stupid parry system, I can't stand games that do that. But if you are more of a casual gamer then I suggest you stay away from this and go buy something more chill, because there is nothing sweatier than Mordhau. "}

While the idea was neat, it REALLY lacked any punch with little to no wow factor. I sort of felt like this great concept for a game and story fell flat on its face at the end. With that being said, I hear there are multiple endings, but I both doubt they are much different and I'm definitely not going to play all the way back through it just to see if I like the other ones.

{"text" : "- Release of Far Cry 3. I downloaded the pirate, after a couple of hours deleted it, went to the store and bought a license. I liked her so much. Passed, naturally I wanted more. That "more" turned out to be Blood Dragon, deliciously in, humor, dragons, 90s movie references. - Then there was the announcement of FC4, I waited, but was very disappointed that EVERYTHING was stupidly copied. Sounds, animation, gameplay. Passed it somewhere for a couple of years, then started, then scored, boring. - Release of Primal. I didn't expect anything and didn't want to, but I got my copy for free. Why not get through? In it, as in previous games, Cntr + C and Cntr + V, without changes, sounds, animation, gameplay. And this time even a map. During the whole game there were a couple of funny moments: 1) When in one of the tents the enemy thrashed his female with cancer. 2) When they piss on your face :) This is where the uniqueness of Primal ends. - FC5 release. Pfft. I already have experience from previous games, I knew what the game would be, Cntr + C and Cntr + V, but did not play. I will skip this part for now. - FC New Dawn release. After some time, Ubisoft launched their subscription and gave free 30 days to everyone who wanted to play their games. Then I persuaded the friend to go through the "New Down". "New Down" is a direct sequel to FC5, but since I didn't expect anything from the series, I didn't care about the sequence of the parts and the plot. Gone. What shit, everything remained in the same places Cntr + C and Cntr + V. Nothing changed. I mastered this part thanks to the co-op; in solo I most likely could not. Well, now back to FC5. I got a good discount and bought it. During the passage, I realized that at 5 and in "New Down" the same card with MINIMUM differences, with all, there is also Cntr + C and Cntr + V. People, people, do you really like coprophilia so much? You are fed with the Lord, and you answer: MORE! MORE! The FC5 has a large map where there is essentially nothing to do. There are 3 large and empty regions in the game. At the time of writing these lines, 1 region has passed completely and partially 2. I'm already tired, boring and monotonous. The character is almost pumped, there is nothing to strive for, he began to learn useless skills. Yubiki: We've introduced planes and helicopters! What for? To fly on an empty map? Introduce a couple of flight missions? Very interesting. The map has one point of capture of posts, for clearing which you get skins, gear and money. Although there are still points with 1-2 houses, which serve only for fast travel. Disgusting character leveling system which later migrated to "New Down". There are 40 percent, if not 50 percent, there are useless skills in the game that no one will use. Someone threw back grenades of enemies or mined vehicles? AI partners are pzdts. Imagine the situation. Checkpoint, a dozen enemies, you stealth with a partner bot. If you stealth, it means that the partner bot also behaves in stealth, runs close to the enemy, sometimes even touches him and hides somewhere, while there is no alarm. Everything is great. I highly do not recommend purchasing, if only at a discount and then, think about it. Completed 3 DLCs: 2 of them have their own flavor, 10 minutes even interesting, and after 10 minutes it all comes down to a banal cleanup and capture of posts / towers. 3rd DLC: A set of silly and boring scenario missions for films that can be completed in co-op competing for points.

{"text" : "This might be longer than I planned. So before you continue reading - answer one question. Are you here for cute girls? If yes - then just buy the game. Even for full prize. Heroines and side characters (but I'm just talking about students) are well written, have their stories, personalities, good and bad sides. Add to that good voice acting! If you expect All ages version - then maybe it's not really good game for you. It's filled with sugestive talks, pantyshots and stuff like that. Sex scenes were cut off and some minor details are lacking but it's still not what I would call "all ages" version. Other thing is h-patch witch.. does not exist. Because why allow people to patch game if they can buy DLC aka Fan disc aka PE W Happiness (and patch it for H-scenes). Somebody here really wants your money I guess. Now to things that caused this review to be negative. Main character (MC) and plot. I just hate MC. In contrast every female character in game loves MC (except servants of evil ofc). He is described as Mr. Perfect all the time. Even compared to Jesus Christ. In the meantime he behaves like total idiot. Plot is terrible. It has more holes than Emmentaler. Mafia is trying to hurt MC? He wins fight by being lucky.. 3 times in a row. Huge debt? Winning lottery ticket! Huge blood loss? No problem - plot armor is there for happy ending :3 Whoever was writing it should abandon the idea of quoting bible and basically whole christianity background. Writers should do their homework before writing stuff like that. It screams "FAKE" each time it appears. Also some research about how schools actually work would be nice. I don't believe that any school head would allow to steer boat or work as lifeguard for student without proper permissions or something like that. What else? That's minor issue - but it's not a dating sim. It's more like kinetic VN (you just have to choose one of 4 routes in the middle of the game). Most choices are fake. For example - you can either help the damsel in distress or not. If you choose to help - MC helps her. If you choose to not - then MC says that it's not his business, walks away... and then says that it's not in his style and helps her anyway.. Other choices that I hate are choices that doesn't change anything... but are counted towards reaching certain route. For example MC have to choose one of the girls to kiss.. but then does nothing. Remember to save at first choice like that - you will have to choose the same girl all the time or you will get bad ending. That's painfull when it comes to replaying and aiming for different route. You have to change decission in all choices - even if you play on full auto and max speed - reaching new route from first choice will take about 1 hour... So be sure that you have something to read to kill the itme. Music is forgettable. Same with backgrounds. Steam overlay is not working and you can't alt+tab the game. To sum up. All effort put in this game was placed upon creating waifu material. Every other aspect of this VN is poorly made. "}

{"text" : "It is unfortunate that such a good game is abandoned and misused by its developers. You can start and get a big surprise with the game, as it is fun, but as you progress, you will realize that it takes years to see the supposed updates that are so speculated fulfilled. That, and that in a Casual game you can be fired by your own team if you don't play well, have a bad connection, etc, etc ,. On the other hand, there is the friendly, helpful community that gives you advice. There it makes you want to really continue playing, it gives you hope. I do not recommend it in the long term. Edited by update: The update had many improvements, some dropped weapons that were exaggeratedly nerfed, since more than luck, it was skill (Or were you good just using those weapons for the first time?). Very nice update, but waiting 15 months for these changes, it should not give us the idea that it makes up for everything. They follow many things that they should have fixed but they preferred to add content that they should also fix. What about arams that are inordinately OP? They are still there for a reason. What happened to being able to join a game of your friend in progress, because that's what this online game is about? Still unable to be. What about bugs in classic maps, Payload maps or maps where there are ways to get trapped because they didn't think that placing those objects there would cause problems for new players (and even experienced players if you didn't realize it)? Nothing, they are still there. It could be a very nice update, I accept it, I even bought the pass because I like the game, but really, do not forget that in a few months it will pass and you will realize that the game is still just as abandoned by the developers. And please, "they are only 4 Dev" is not an excuse for a multimillion dollar company that can hire more, in addition there are people from the community who have offered to help, a clear example that they do not care is the immense amount of good workshop that exists and is never incorporated. Oh yeah. The game finder is just as broken. Thank you for getting me into finished games after waiting 10 minutes or for getting into one where one or two players must do everything because the other team's team is full of level 100-150. 07/07/18: Year 3000, we still have no news regarding updates. The game was dead again, like any year. The only few users they have, keep the game alive, otherwise it would fall into oblivion (That and which is one of the best F2Ps on Steam to download). Apparently they already let you join the friend's game, as long as you have to start the game again, change the map, etc, etc. Until then you must wait. The balanced car .. Well, for not wanting to do better, they took off the burden of moving even if you don't want to, even when there are 3 seconds left to finish and they ruin your entire hour of playing to lose. Yes, you will say "It's casual", but ironically not even its "Competitive" works well, leaving Casual as the last option. And yes, if you come to tell me "There are community servers", then delete Casual, Competitive, or uninstall the game because you are giving me to understand that everything they incorporate has an excavation and that the game is perfect. I still don't recommend it, at least in the long term. "}

{"text" : "Although this is no longer so relevant, I think it is worth writing a review. Firstly, I want to congratulate the people who bought Fallout 4 from the bottom of my heart. Comrades, colleagues in misfortune, deceived by the harsh life and bribed by the authority of a well-known company, who bought this game and subsequently realized their mistake, as well as coprophiles who happily tasted this chocolate fruit. colors, but by no means chocolate in nature, and those who highly appreciated it, being fabulously refined gourmets, congratulations, money wasted. This product is a typical representative of the now popular production strategy, which implies a quick release of something with the expectation of minimum costs and multiple paybacks, maximum income, while the buyer's interests in obtaining a suitable product are pushed back, if not ignored at all. Bethesda, blinded by the success of the old days, decided that they had enough of releasing games for consumers, it's time to do it for the sake of pure profit and nothing more. Against the background of the success of the previous parts, Fallout 4 was highly anticipated and racked up, high hopes were pinned on it, now peacefully resting at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, surrounded by its inhabitants. All expectations crashed with a bang on the wretchedness of the game, which takes roots even before the start of production, in the very attitude of the developer company to the product and to the release goal. Fallout 4 has lagged behind its time by several years, and now, when the progressive leaps in the gaming industry take place every couple of months, this lag is more and more painful. The expected promising open world turned out to be rather scanty and monotonous, there are no unique objects and locations. The atmosphere is not as addictive and comprehensive as it was originally drawn. Minimal elaboration of characters and dialogues. Sarcasm, which has become the talk of the town. But about all this later and in more detail. We have a dull, empty, uninteresting game, the real cost of which is overestimated by 3 times. Fallout 4 can be considered as a story-driven offline shooter with RPG elements, but even here it is no higher than 3/10. Should you buy it? Everyone's business, I can only say that I missed the release and bought the game without high expectations, knew what I was doing, and still was disappointed. 1/10. This is a fail. A large number of hours have been played offline. All of the above is based on my personal beliefs and my own subjective, perhaps to some extent preconceived opinion. "}

Many people say about the Poles, which skating rinks are ruining. So I say, "NIHU I like that." It is always unpleasant for me to play with Russian-speaking gamers: those who have a microphone in their mouth (in the literal sense), someone does not have it at all (no information - the skating rink has been drained), noobs in high ranks (1-1-11 ). Another problem is cheaters! Especially at more or less high ranks. Of course, it is difficult to identify a real cheater, but there are also 100%. Developers do not particularly struggle with them, and this is the problem. Anti-cheat - g about in n about !!!! They also allegedly spoil the game with skins, but I can't say anything about this, because I came into the game when they were already there.

People spend their real time and money, and in-game resources and mission progress are largely dependent on third parties in the game. And the developer company has not been able to settle this for so many years ?! But they added blasters, lasers and a flying can with a rudder and homing missiles. It would be better if the servers were added and divided realistically, if you want to mod, go left, if you want a quality game with normal cars and weapons, go right. Everyone here seems to be happy! And yours and ours, as they say. Review supplement from May 2020. A nuance of the Online mode characteristics of this product. There is no paid subscription, but no need for one. You buy cards () wanting to legally and quickly pump your character in terms of capabilities. Buying a vehicle also requires a lot of in-game currency. Even if you won an expensive vehicle in a casino, then welcome to the expensive pumping of the car, while it can drive with the dynamics and grace of a tram or trolleybus, and sell it with all the upgrades for a penny (about a third of the price of a car without upgrades). - this is a real casino, it doesn't matter what or what to play - you will pay, and the daily draw will keep you at close range. - and you pay for it, imperceptibly, but very much in total. Ammunition, parachutes and body armor are not very expensive, but run out quickly and more often without the player's initiative. This is one of the reasons why cheaters are beneficial to the developer - they spend your resources for you, and you, in turn, spend in-game currency to buy new ones. Also for insurance of cars destroyed by the same persons. Oh yeah! The game has it! Every in-game day, in-game money is debited from your accounts for the maintenance and maintenance of real estate, enterprises, as well as the payment of salaries to assistants, which, by the way, are often not available at the right time (by the way, it is often impossible to drive a mechanic with a car to the right place). *** The biggest thing that did not like in this game is the attitude of the developer and his work on the project in the period when there are already many users there is feedback, there are complaints, there are claims, wishes. It 's frustrating because it' s not a small company of three people working in a basement in an old house in a small village. Who have no money, have an old 56k modem and a pair of laptops. Players are buying for real money game items and resources that can be wasted, by unscrupulous players cheaters or modders, no matter how to call mostly someone who does not respect himself and others. You can lose your progress, your resources, some exclusive vehicles that you found in LS. RockStar himself provokes a break and negative and without cheaters. They sell lasers, blasters and flying vehicles with self-targeting weapons. I think it's okay, but than they must do more additional servers where players possible to choose to use or not weapons and transport by alien technology.

{"text" : "Ahhh after giving a lot of chances to this game...I now have to say it, nothing is going to change. Okay first of all, the game is just a cheap copy of L4D2 but with aliens instead of zombies, there some special aliens (aka special infected) like Beast (Tank), Thresher (Hunter), Whiplash (Something like Smoker&Jockey mixed), Sapper (Spitter&Boomer mixed), Blackout and Enranger (which suprisingly aren't any kind of copy from L4D2's infected). There are a lot of guns, only few melee weapons tho, and some other lore stuff you can find in each map... "But just because it's a copy of L4D2 doesn't mean it's not a good game" -Graphics: Game's graphics are just horrible, if you consider in what year it was released in, and its specs. I play the game on high graphics and it really sucks.Blood almost doesn't even exist in this game. -Environement: Well some maps have great envirenoment but most look the same boring sh*t. -Gameplay: Gameplay is really mediocore, survivors barely communicate with each other, and it gets boring really fast.Guns feel like it's the same thing, gunfires are similar and their dmg isn't really satisfying.There are two modes (at least on solo, haven't checked multi yet, and I doubt im going to) Campaign and Invasion (typical survival). In campaign mode you have to go from point A to point B just like L4D etc etc....nothing new, nothing special (especially when you have to deal with all this emptiness in the world and lack of survivor's depth)  In invasion mode you have to survive several waves, again...same typical sh*t nothing new. The game feels...like a dead corpse there is nothing that keeps your adrenaline at max lvl, it's just the same thing over and over and over and over again, no because it's "from point A to point B" style, but because the game feels EMPTY. Sound: -Just bad lol...0 imagination and variation of music Bots: -Believe it or not....L4D2's bots ARE BETTER.....Yea even on Master skill bots are a ♥♥♥♥ lame. Difficulty: -Nightmare with these bots even on Regular. Also there are only a few resources, It happened to end the map, and I hadn't found any ammo drop at all. All in all, the game is really mediocore, it offers nothing new to the player, it feels really empty and I really don't know why does this game even exist. Overall: 3/10 "}

{"text" : "Worst game from Valve and one of the worst CCGs so far. They promised us an interesting game, independent of randomness and donation. And what we got. Cons: - Price. For cardboard boxes, the price tag is 1400 rubles, I understand that in fact we only pay for packs, but still. -Donat. I can't say 100 percent that in order to win in this game you have to pay, because there is no ranked, and I have not played with personal decks (but the fact that Ax costs 1500 for TP seems to decide). The point is different, without donation you will not be able to collect a complete collection of cards. The only way to get cards for free is to play Arenki, and then they are bought for tickets, but for the purchase of the game they give 5 tickets. If you can do 3+ wins every time, then there are no questions (for 3 wins, a ticket for 4 and 5 wins with + pack is compensated), but what if you run out of tickets? There is no other way to get a ticket by paying at the moment. -Lack of in-game currency. As it was said earlier, for free you will not get anything except what they give for buying the game. The absence of any reward for winning the party. Since there is no competitive mode, there is essentially no point in playing if you only want to understand the mechanics of the game or try to farm packs in the arena. -Modes. The game only has 2 main modes (not counting the game with bots or friends). This is a common game against a random opponent in which you play your own collection, created from your cards, in a paid or free version. And Draft (arena) - a mode in which you alternately choose two of the cards presented to you until you have 60 of them, and of these 60 cards you need to make a deck of 40+ cards that you will later play. The game lasts either up to 5 wins or up to 2 losses. -Duration of matches. Matches last 30-40 minutes on average. I cannot say that this is bad, but there is no motivation in the regular (free) mode, because they don’t give anything for it. -Connection system. If you take the same cs: go or Dota there, if your game crashed or your computer went down, you are given a certain time, in most cases you managed to re-enter for this, your teammates could take a break, waiting for you. But here, if you have lost the game, and even worse comp. That's all, there is no point in re-entering. A game like you gives you 3 minutes to restart, but if you are out, the game does not stop, and during this time while you restart the game, the enemy manages to win you. -Random. This is why I started writing this review. All the disadvantages that were before can be attributed to the fact that the game has just been released and will be improved, but the whole game is built on this. In this game, almost nothing depends on you. The game itself decides on which lane the creeps will be sent, where they will hit, to the tower or to the creature, what cards you will have with your starting hand, the effect of the card will work with a 25-50% chance or not. You can only put the hero on the chosen lane, but the game itself will decide what position and where he will hit. Of the pros, I can only single out two things: -Gameplay. The idea itself with 3 playing fields is interesting, at first it was even more than interesting to play, it was something new (something similar was in Gwent, but it was not that). Not a bad idea with the colors of the cards and their uses (if a hero of a certain color is on the line, then you can only use those cards that are of the same color as the hero). -Visual component. Nice, eye-catching graphics, with a nice soundtrack. But there is no external customization. In short, at this point in time I do not recommend the game for purchase. We are waiting for fixes, adding something new and changing the mechanics of the game, because at the moment this is a game of coin, whoever is lucky. "}

{"text" : "Each review is separate, and my comprehensive evaluation of this DLC is: very uneconomical. The following [points] represent the virtual currency that needs to be recharged in RMB in the game. [W currency] below represents the game when you perform Game, the free game currency given to you after the game is over———— I have been playing on the international server for more than two weeks (as of August 9th, it can be counted as three weeks, I used to be a Tencent national server player, and then there was a short period of time I played Russian server after TX closed down), I have this DLC and DLC of 158. The total krypton gold is more than 3000RMB. I plan to stay in Krypton to play this online game in the future. I plan to wait until the new special action "blackout" comes out. A wave of krypton gold. If you don’t care if you have a lot of money like me, and feel that the “not worth” I said above is nonsense, please send money to the agent. I would be very happy to see this agent making a lot of money, because In any case, it is more conscientious than the previous Tencent agents-before giving advice to Mengxin who want to support agents for Krypton Gold, let me talk about the naked Krypton (direct charge) points in the game are 1820 points and 138 yuan (based on real-time USD The error of the ratio against RMB is within ±4RMB). The solution I recommend most to Mengxin is actually not the DLC of 158. That set of DLC is the most valuable and cost-effective DLC for non-Mengxin players who want Krypton, but when it comes to using the least money and the fastest integration into the game and When some players regretted that they would not pay too much tuition due to various reasons (usually slow response, easy to be abused, even simple PVE, 3D vertigo, etc.), I suggest you buy the two sets of 88 DLC One set: each set of full-professional camouflage; each set of independent full-professional character model skins (the game has been in the game for so many years, the character model skins have not seen skins with attributes except for female characters that look smaller in HITBOX area); 45-day bonus (100% experience bonus bonus, 50% arsenal unlock bonus, 75% money bonus item); I can say that 2000 points alone will pay back, let alone give you a free set of attribute bonus skins The rewards of this, and the character skins, I think since you have read this review, you should read it again, and have a little understanding of the expensive permanent weapon repair fees of this agent. If you are a brand new account, there is no VIP You really don’t have the motivation to brush pictures... Mengxin should really only play PVE to familiarize yourself with the game UI and game environment. Don’t come to PVP to harm your teammates for the time being.. I have seen two PVP players with over 20 levels in the Expert Channel. During the whole trip to the supermarket, I suspect that he hasn't even pressed the shift key to run away. Anyway, he is sending points...A long way, speaking of the main body, why this set of DLC is as of August 9, 2017 This is the most "not cost-effective" DLC: 1. No points to send 2. Although there are many equipment attributes, but the value is low in front of 248. Before talking about equipment attributes, let's popularize a wave of knowledge (the following is transferred from Baidu warface post. []) "The helmet provides protection for the head. Note that the head protection can only reduce the damage rate of the headshot. For example, the original headshot rate of an assault rifle is 500% (5.0x), and 70% of the head protection performance Reduce the headshot rate to 430% (4.3x), and the 20% head protection can only be reduced to 480% (4.8x). Armor points (AP) absorb 80% of the damage, and the remaining 20% ​​are directly damaged Life points (HP). Melee damage ignores armor. It should be reminded that all players are 125HP. Gloves & Shoes gloves and military boots Note that the protection provided by gloves and military boots covers the entire arm and thigh." The comparison below refers to the game You can use game currency to purchase and compare: Highlights: Almost immune to flash effects. PVP will absorb the explosion when grabbing the gun position at the beginning of the game (but you will find that usually the position of the gun aiming point is the lightning point, and most of the grenade (At that time, two or three grains came together) Value comparison: Champion series helmet only has 20% protection (warlord 60%) Champion series helmet only engineering department and snipers can see mines Champion series vest only has 100 armor points (large Part of the game currency can be bought The armor of the champion series vest is 150 points), the champion series vest automatically restores the armor when it is not in the pit state, even if the champion series vest does not automatically restore the armor, no matter which occupation, there is no bullet bonus.. The champion series gloves have only two attributes. , (Similar to entry-level game currency gloves) In general, if you play PVP, you may only use one or two of them, and you will definitely not play the whole set...

{"text" : "This is one of those games where if I was just discussing the design, the basic quality of the dialogue / characterisation, or the graphics, I could be pretty positive and wax lyrical about it. But when it comes to the game itself..... urghhhhh...that's a harder aspect to muster much energy for, so why waste time doing a big old song and dance setting the scene about the rest of it. It's set at the beginning of the 20th century, and uses historical figures to build its fictional narrative. Nikolai Tesla, the chap who created electricity, has gathered a group of scientists upon a boat called the Helios. These great scientific minds have been set free to push the boundaries of invention, and inevitably have done gone ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things up royally with their experiments. Faecal matter gonna be hittin' the fan big time. You play as Rose Archer, whose sister Ada is a scientist aboard the Helios. Having received a letter begging her to come to the vessel, Rose sets off to investigate.  What awaits her arrival? Well, that would be spoilers.  But I can tell you what awaits you as the player. Getting bored out of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mind by a tepid walking simulator.  It takes bloody ages for anything to happen, and when it does it's a chase sequence that for whatever reason just doesn't nail being pant-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrifying. Then you play for another hour or more with ♥♥♥♥ all happening, before getting another chase sequence that failed to get my adrenaline pumping, or my heart pounding. In between these distinctly mediocre and simplistic bouts of "gameplay" there are a couple of effective jump scares, albeit nothing particularly subtle or clever. You walk along and something goes bang, or a nut job pops up and goes "oooga wooga" before running off.  It startled me, but scared? nope, and that's not because I have nerves of steel either. It's just that the game is so familiar with it's choices for instilling fear, and is then a bit pish when it comes to doing anything more than ham-fistedly aping "horror tactics 101" Sometimes you'll have to jump over obstacles during these running sequences, and it doesn't feel as smooth as, say, Outlast. It kind of punctures the tension of "I'm in a race for my life, can't slow down!....Except to slightly sluggishly, and awkwardly, vault this table".  It might even be an intentional attempt at racking up the fear by forcing you to slow down, but that lack of fluidity to your movement just makes it feel clunky. And the ease with which these events can be completed, both in terms of the number of attempts taken to complete (3 maximum at most, and even the later ones are not challenging) and the absence of any terror, shows a lack of skill in building up tension. They're tedious rather than exciting. Which just leaves the story, and that is passable at best. The tone is grim and serious, but the most memorable elements come from a character who is blackly humourous and seems somewhat out of place. Emotive beats just don't hit home, and the science fiction / drama etc are all unoriginal and underwhelming. It's all a bit bland, despite having a fair bit of oomph visually in it's design and technical prowess.   Having finished it I'd have to say that it really doesn't come together all that satisfactorily. It hasn't tried to be overly clever and deliver a twist ending, but I don't think it nailed some of the elements. There's not a feeling of much being at stake, and without going into spoilers quite a few things feel like  their explanations are either a bit rushed, or just glossed over as "timey wimey" stuff.  Maybe if you're more clued up on time travel / relativity than I am, it might make more sense. In a nutshell this is a visually slick, seemingly fairly capable technical experience, with impressive design. And that's it. The gameplay is distinctly "meh" with something like 5 sequences of insipid running away, and the story, whilst reasonably written and voice acted, is pretty "meh" too.  It's a 5 out of 10 game, so no recommended. Not so awful that I couldn't bring myself to finish it, but having done so I can't think of one single thing about it, beyond that oh-so-reflective surface level of it's art deco styled looks, to get even vaguely enthusiastic about.

The game itself feels boring, and the background story is completely incomprehensible. The scene maps are repeated, the trees, mobs, and walls have basically not changed at all. There are few types of mobs, and their skills are completely uninteresting. The protagonist can only use one move, double kills with his left and right hands. After taking the props, it is still the same except for remote attacks. The levels are nothing new at present, they are all very straightforward large open spaces. After playing a few small levels, they encounter the BOSS level and then promote the plot. There is no alternative route. The items are a bit similar to Isaac. Picking up different items will have different skills, but they are not as diverse as advertised (it may be that I did not hit them), and the degree of repetition is high. The props are basically increased blood, and the effects of different fruits and vegetables are the same. In terms of action, I don’t feel as good as the famine blow. After being beaten, there is basically no rigidity. It is very likely that you did not react and you died. The mobs can hardly A to death, BOSS fights and fights, repeating several times is not very difficult.

But these are very rare especially if you play solo. ..The you no longer need to pray to have with you some smart players. And not to mention the new point system, of which the Dev ons also forget to take certain course of the game that can literally prevent you from progressing: The zero are present by way of illustration, I speak of the absence of a medal (I remind me of the exact term) when the points are distributed at the end of the game :) -0 point if you don't have to do with the killer of the game or a survivor (which is much rarer!) -0 point if you do not heal you are ally or take them off with a hook (Hey how smart you do if no player gets hanged on the hook? !!) -0 point if you don't take care of a minimum of generator (Well yeah you're not going to ask the killer to go and pursue another survivor in order to be able to make a generator! .. LOL!) Is these for the survivors, But also know Neo (why do I call you Neo ?. ..brief!) That it is also the same for the killers! In short, as well as a very long paving stone to say that this game is as good as it is bad (pay your paradox!)

{"text" : "When I bought this game, I fell for the beautiful screenshots and colorful descriptions of the gameplay. But in vain. This game is another representative of an endless stream of survival games. Naturally in Early Access. The gameplay consists of survival on the island, where you have to craft various tools for survival, build houses, and get food. And if you don't like the island, you can always blame it on another. Almost exactly the same. I did not notice the cooperative in the game. We survive alone. The goal of the game is to hold out as long as possible. There is no motivation other than to explore the possibilities of crafting. Physics in the game is "great". The hero does not hesitate to row through the liferaft. The graphics are not impressive on closer inspection. The grass looks like some kind of porridge. Textures lack clarity. Not everything is in order with shadows either. The hero does not cast a shadow, but the paddle does. Where is the logic? There are also bright sides. The sunsets in the game turned out to be excellent. The water looks like real. Summer and the beach immediately come to mind. In winter, you can launch the game and enjoy the bright sun and the calm surface of the endless ocean. The game was slated to exit Early Access by the end of this year. When I bought the game it was version 0.01, and now version 0.05. The game is likely destined to join the roster of survival games that will never make it out of Early Access. (Hello DayZ!) If you love games where you have to entertain yourself and you are willing to put up that this game will most likely never come out of Early Access, then give it a try. The rest are better off passing by. No final version of the game - no rating. P.S. Achievements for 11 months have not earned. Although they were introduced as soon as the game came out. "}

{"text" : "1.) Call of Duty 4: Remastered Right in front. Hardware on top, configuration etc. also everything on top. Since you can't write a separate review for MWR somehow, it just has to be included here. For an oldschooler the release day was more than clear, IW was not even downloaded, but MWR of course. The anticipation was enormous. There was even a touch of nostalgia and everyone got down to work. Downloaded, started and? "What the hell:" Shader cache is being filled. "Honestly, ladies and gentlemen, my first and really first thought was: OK, now I don't just have the feeling that you no longer have any PC developers, but now it is definitely official! The mood was right in the basement and only the "peer pressure" kept me from not minimizing and killing the process. Since it was then, compared to many others in our country, "fast", I did all given a chance as one of the first. Conclusion? No, another WTF moment. In my mind: "I'm playing Black Ops 1 or what !?" And damn it, the entire game physics was and is Black Ops 1 Well then I thought, why not? Very simple. If it says "Call of Duty 4 Remastered" then please really the CoD and not Black Ops 1 in Call of Duty 4 guise! Yes of course it's OK, apart from the ones initial jerks (such as crash 1st round or backlot) even after the möch tegern patches. How the hell do you come up with something like that, what is wrong with you guys ?? After the last massive feedback (little to no positive) at BO3, did you have a real chance, if not the last grace period, and hit the wall so hard? I cannot and will not understand that! That just shows how indifferent you have become to your primary platform. It would have been enough to make the graphics a little prettier and to add a few nice gimmicks, why change the game physics? Why? It has nothing to do with Call of Duty 4! A triple-A shooter cannot and must not completely ignore it, everything has to be crisp and snappy, like it was in CoD4. As it was and is and especially not on such high hardware! Let's get to the FPS Cap next. Why? It makes zero sense and is totally counterproductive. Oh yes and the FoV values ​​btw. are still wrong. You can only clap your hands over your head. You just don't deliver something like that. Furthermore, I fully support the opinion of pcgames, only I go one step further and say the lights are already off. Why? There are hardly any players online, even fewer than in Black Ops 3. Even Farmin Simulator 2017 sells better and has more players. Not to mention the disaster in the Windows Store. Is that hate or anger? No, it's simply pure disappointment and despair, nothing more. It's just a shame :(. 2 :) Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare ... then came an evening where I briefly thought: "Ok, no idea when I'll play it, but you can do Infinite Warfare Download at least once, use the nice function save and restore games and save the whole thing once as a virtual data carrier as a backup on the server (thanks to a network drive). Shortly after downloading and creating the disc, I dared to do it once and started the game. Surprise No. 1 shader fuss went a lot faster here. Surprise No. 2? The game runs smoothly compared to MWR. Sure a few drops here and there and mouse is not optimal, but definitely For a long time, to be more precise since MW2, once again a feeling of jagged and crisp. Unfortunately, the joy of it was only short-lived, because the rest of the game is then simply usable. You think more of a mess than with Black Ops 3 does not work? But IW can easily top that. You have to admit, today I started it again for a short lap, but really only for one lap, because otherwise you can't take it any longer, especially the sounds ... just to notice the performance difference again. As I said, not optimal either, but compared to the last parts .... well you know. In conclusion, we have now reached a point where you think that's it for good. But it could also be the perfect time to start over from scratch. A point where you throw everything overboard and start at zero. Quasi a Call of Duty (the call of duty), or as we put it colloquially, duty calls ......... "}

{"text" : "Why did I buy it, I knew that it was a shrine, but because I had nothing to do and nothing to play, I still bought it at a discount for 560 rubles. Even this game is definitely not worth this money, in order to play it you need to pay something else to the player. A boevka is just a torture chamber, well, how could it be made so crappy, for me it is a world-wide mystery, why bitch, hey otpiulivatsya from some chicken 1 levla. The level design was done in my opinion by a person who was simply mentally retarded, this genius simply poked all sorts of bumps and hills and stuck all kinds of vegetation between them. The map is very small and very boring to explore. The map itself is divided into climatic zones, but the transitions are made very abrupt and unnatural. AI at the Pacman level from arcade machines from the 80s, if you aggro hostile NPCs, they will follow you in circles, like in the Benny Hills show, and will completely ignore your companion. The graphics are similar to those in Gitika 4, they have not progressed at all. Here and there, every third NPC has a cloned ebalnik. And by the way, the faces here are so ugly, as if they were crookedly converted from The Sims 3, of course there is no lipstick in the game, the mouths just open and close. The eyebrows of all the characters look like smeared plasticine. I think that Piranha Bytes just needs to be deprived of the license to make any games.

{"text" : "Even writing about it is boring, because everything is bad in the game, except for the visual style of the characters and the music. And since this is a game and not a music video, everything is bad. The lack of balance of characters, when support not only heals damage from 2-3 opponents, but also deals damage no worse than other classes, which is why all battles are reduced to catching support from the crowd. It makes no sense to fight 1 on 1, even the attacking classes have little damage to quickly kill, and the enemy will run away or help will come. Huge maps, where there is nothing to do, most of the time you wait for the activation of capture points or energy discharge, and you try to catch a crowd of enemy support or a lonely autistic person. The lack of depth, the whole depth is the IQ level of your team, it makes no sense to run alone, the fight itself comes down to pressing LMB to attack the target, and 3 skills that are used as you recharge. Changing the hero does not change the monotony. Selecting targets looks pathetic even for consoles, shooting with auto guidance loses its meaning, you do not need skills for this. All abilities will automatically aim at the target, do not miss. Parrying also applies, it is like a 5 leg of a dog, when you are attacked by 4, you have no time for timings, this is not For honor, where is your personal skill, something decides in battle. Customization is primitive, 3 character enhancement modules that enhance hotel skills, as well as 3 costumes that differ in color, is this in an online game? Online, already on release at the 2k level, in a week it will not remain at all, you can play with your friends, if of course they want to BUY the game, when there is a huge selection of free games. The idea of ​​hand-to-hand fighting has not been realized, in fact, 6 out of 12 heroes are arrows. The most boring online game I've ever played, and even the low price does not compensate for this, and the F2P model cannot save it. After 3 fights, it became sickening to play, this is a record, online games should be at least a little delayed, Bleeding Edge has the opposite, the longer you play, the less you want, it is terribly primitive and monotonous. You can say the intro, the best part of the game, the further the game only disappoints. Even playing with friends will not be able to delay for a long time, and it makes sense for friends to spend money on this. But the visual style, characters and music are good. "}

The one inherent flaw in this games in the excessive, soul-numbing grinding. If you would have asked me by hour 10, even hour 20 if this was a good game I'd have said yes. The main issue is that it's a 10-20 hour game that's stretched out to 60-80 hours with just nothing but excessive grinding. Key things are setup in away that you need to discover them through trial and error using precious resources. Critical resources are setup to come in at a drip feed that artificially slows progress. It's fine for the first while but just gets so brutal. There are ways to automate a few things later on which is great but still doesn't help nearly enough. My experience was like this. - Hour 0-20: I'm having a good time. - Hour 21-40: Okay, if I just grind enough I'll get a new thing and this will be fun again. - Hour 40+: Nope, gonna cheat and hack in all the stuff I need to finish this because I'm so done with this. Even when cheating the grind was just too much. I couldn't bring myself to even come close to finishing this. I looked up the ending on YouTube and I'm not really missing much. My time is too valuable to waste any more of it finishing this. All in all, this could be an absolutely fantastic game with some much needed balance tweaks, but I think anyone that finishes it in its current state is just a victim of the sunk cost fallacy. "}

{"text" : "Dredd vs Death is a short, dystopian fps where you go through the levels helping the citizens of mega city one until inevitablly you are sent somewhere else to help people and fight punks, cultists and undead until you eventually learn that 4 boss characters have escaped from prison and then you help the people where the boss characters went and beat the bosses, until you beat the final one, Death. The fps gameplay is mostly standard, you get to have 2 weapons maximum and you have to keep the pistol that all judges use. The judge pistol has several ammunition options such as explosive. flammble. and ricocheting options, but I found that they werent particularly useful or even detrimental; lighting people on fire didnt seem to do much damage and if they run towards you then you risk being burned. The high explosive mode doesn't have a huge radius for hitting enemies and most of the time its not worth the time required to change ammo from the normal ammunition. Additionally, on some levels you don’t get much of a refill on the judge pistol and usually have to rely on using an alternate weapon and these alternate pistol modes use your limited ammo faster. There is also some unneeded fluff such as  a reputation system where reputation increases when you arrest people and help citizens not get killed and decreases when you attack friendly targets and people who have already surrendered to be arrested; but this only matters for ratings unless you have the lowest reputation by killing friendlies, then the game will cause a mission failure. At some times there were bugs such as me sniping off some enemies that were set to be killed by a script and that caused a mission failure. Something that can get annoying at times is that its not clear where your next objective is, but the gameplay is fairly passable fps gameplay once you get past the bugs. The music in the game wasn't particularly memorable to me, but the dystopian setting and various advertisements for dubious fictional future products added to the atmosphere of the game. Given the short length and dated graphics in this game, I wouldn’t go out of my way to pick this up, but it was in a bundle and I got my copy from trading so I figured why not. Unless you really love the Dredd universe no matter the implementation, there are better games for your money. "}
{"text" : "Turning my review from recommended to not recommended, here is why. As everything Ubisoft touched they also ruined Trackmania, the game was supposed to run very easily at highest graphics with 100+ FPS even on my problematic PC, however, as time went on they slowly ruined the optimization one by one. It isn't the beautiful game for race game fans that can't run high end games like Forza or Need for Speed could at least have fun racing experience without requiring a good pc while having amazing graphics, each update slows the game down, this happened with Rocket League as well, but at least they did some important updates for the game so it's acceptable how system requirements got up, Trackmania however, has no excuse. The only gameplay changing feature was just one road for Stadium which made you jump high, the only other important update was just a UI change, and that's when the problem officially started but it really didn't bring something to the gameplay itself it was basically just a simpler and modernized UI which for some reason some sort of a downgrade for main menus of the games, now it just has a still picture rather then an animation in the background, Overall if you can still run it, good for you, but it removed one of the most important things about the game that made this game stand out for me throughout my childhood, I will miss the days I was able to play the game with good looking graphics. ALSO I want to talk about the pricing for a sec. WHAT. THE. HECK?!  The game doesn't give nearly enough things for it to be this expensive, I know servers are a feature but hosts of the servers still have to pay for them so what's the point?! "}

All this is accompanied by cheerful laughter, and at the same time conversations for life, because what else to do in a board game, how not to talk about what happened six months ago, right? And the fact that it looks perfect live in the virtual world starts to look extremely lousy. Let's close our eyes to the fact that in a computer game not all the rules from the tabletop "Carcassonne" work, and sometimes refuse to work when it comes to controversial situations with the division of territory. Let's close our eyes to the fact that if a player starts winning, the computer dummies begin to play along with each other in order to equalize the chances. In general, it is possible to write off a very lively tactic - “bring down the leader”, but with real people it at least does not look so open. Let's close our eyes, both to the price tag, and to the fact that not all additions saw the light of day in this version of the game. Developers are busy people too, so they don't have time to adapt anything. Let's take a better look at the overall impression: Microphone support? Better use Discord. A pleasant soundtrack that doesn't distract you but creates the right mood? Pf-f-f, who needs it? Stable game without bugs? Who do you take developers for? Stable departures every 20-25 minutes, here is their answer. The ability to customize the color and order of players' turn? Yeah, schaz! As the game wants, you will walk, otherwise you are smart what. Displaying avatars? No, well, of course you are. Just register in our service, which you will never use and that's it. The developers will even give a figurine of the abbot for free. Can you imagine what generosity? The free title (figure) that comes with the original game here requires you to just spend a certain amount of time getting it. Why not a challenge? I understand that each of these shortcomings is insignificant and one could close our eyes to this if the game was live online. But he is not. That is, either by some miracle, get together with your board game friends at a virtual table, or play with bots. In the case of the latter, an extremely dubious pleasure. And this makes you believe that not all board games can be adapted for the PC, well, or just the hands of the developers grow out of a causal place, so lucky. 4 out of 10 fucking dragons "}

{"text" : "In all honesty, I'm a seasoned player and regularly play FPS and TPS games, daily, oftentimes for hours on end. In roughly 25 years of gaming, I never had any problems with a single one of them. But this game... this game is 'special' in a really bad way. I don't mind some screenshaking and head-bobbing... lots of games have it and it never bothered me. But here it is RIDICULOUSLY high. On my search of a way to reduce it or turn it off, I stumbled upon so many threads on so many forums, where people are reporting that it renders it unplayable for them... more than I've ever seen for any other game before. And I can totally understand it. I'm a normal human being and not suffering from motion sickness. This game isn't inducing it either. I don't feel nauseous or anything... but it's really on the brink. It strains my eyes. They HURT. After just 30 minutes of playing this abomination of a screenshaking simulator, they're throbbing. I'm actually happy I alt-tabbed out of it right now, writing this review so my eyes can get a little rest. I'm not kidding! It really is THAT bad. Funnily enough they added it to give it a natural feeling. But it is SO MUCH that it feels completely unnatural and uncomfortable and it looks like ♥♥♥♥. Cut scenes are by far the worst. Even the cinematics that are no hand-cam shots and which are depicting fairly quiet scenes - like Lara sitting next to a camp fire - are shaking worse than the landing scene in Saving Private Ryan (again: I'm not exaggerating)! It's frantically jittering and flickering like crazy every second! When Lara is sitting at that camp fire, talking into the radio, you can't even fix her eyes in the close-up, because it's shaking so hard. She's calmly sitting next to a camp fire ffs! There are no explosions, no action, nothing. And the screen is shaking as if there's a Soviet artillery barrage at the start of the Berlin offensive... It is just ridiculous. If I were to refrain from sleeping for three days, drank 10l of coffee, get my hands broken and hosed down with icy water I could hold a handcamera more stable than that... When even someone who doesn't have motion sickness is having issues and can tell that this is totally overboard, something is really screwed up. Some people are making fun of the ones who get sick from this game... I feel like anyone who DOESN'T get affected at all by this amount of screen shaking can't possibly be sentient. I honestly cannot understand that they thought this was a good idea and it is absolutely pathetic that in more than 5 years they haven't patched an option into the game to turn this off, despite so many complaints and pleads from the players.  Same goes for the missing FoV slider... the terrible FoV basically goes hand-in-hand with the shaking and only makes it worse. There might be a good game underneath that earthquake footage that is going on on my screen, but after just 30 minutes of playing, I seriously don't know if I can torture myself to play through it.

{"text" : "This has been permanently free on the developer's website for a long time now (years, perhaps). Meaning that anyone who doesn't own this game who is reading this can be glad to know they can pay for this game exactly what this game is worth- nothing. [Meanwhile, having paid for the game, I just have to accept regret over the fact.] There's a laundry list of issues with the game, ranging from stability to interface to tech tree design to combat to AI to.. well, basically everything is lackluster. But see, I don't have to cover any of that in detail, because there's a much simpler way to describe this game: This game is a Master of Orion clone where each and every single gameplay system feels *significantly* dumbed down [combat most especially] compared to the game's spiritual predecessors, while none of the shortcomings of those predecessors are meaningfully addressed by this game.  In short, there's no real reason to play this game over games from the late 90s and early 2000s. Hell, even Wargaming's extremely shoddy MoO4 game is probably* somewhat more involved than this game [I haven't played MoO3, so I can't comment on that comparison].  * ( Honestly, both games have started getting confused in my head, with one mindnumbing, unpleasant, shallow MoO-imitating experience just kinda blurring into the other. ) The game does have several mods which improve the game, but with such a shallow foundation (this being one of the least fun 4x games I've ever played, along with MoO4) and with the mods only tweaking existing features using the limited modding functions the game has available, there's just not enough there to salvage this game. Again, this is free, so go make your own judgement. But if you've got something else to play, I really recommend you go spend your time there, instead. With both this and MoO4, I only feel like I wasted my time- and as someone who finds 4x/sim games [along with card, board, and racing games] easily appealing even when the games in question compare poorly to others in their genre, it's really a first for me to encounter games of that general style wherein I can't at least manage some sort of minor, niche engagement to make the experience worthwhile.  I've still got some hopes for Endless Space 2, since there's definitely a framework there that could be fun if it was fleshed out. The problem is that right now, you've got a skeleton without any flesh, that's even lacking internal organs in certain places [again, the combat is a huge disappointment, what with it effectively being nonexistant]. In essence, a prototype of a game. Which'd be fine if there weren't already other MoO clones, nevermind the original MoO games to compare [disfavorably] to.  Meanwhile, this game feels like the developers did hold an appreciation for the genre style they were working to, but that appreciation never seems to have turned into devotion, passion, or even just a strong interest. It feels like a child who loves puppies, got a puppy, and then realized that taking care of them was too much of a bother, and just kinda settled in the basic care necessities and then left the dog to its own devices. Put another way, the game (within its "collection" release) feels like the original Warlock: Master of the Arcane pre-DLCs, for anyone familiar with that rather shallow and lackluster experience. Unfortunately, that is a game which did also have several DLCs of its own, so that comparison isn't really a flattering one for Endless Space. "}

Why can't I make 6 miners, 2 gatherers and 2 woodcutters? Why? Why then put a global priority on loot, fight or "balance"? It is so annoying when your miner, in whom you put a bunch of books and time goes to the other side of the map to pick up resources, instead of digging a tunnel, that there is not enough evil. 2. It is impossible to set the sequence of actions / priority Again, why, when you want to dig a maze or, on the contrary, make blocks of a map, you cannot choose by priority which block to put next, or which tree to cut first? Too much time is spent on manual labor. 3. Give only 1 coin per player's overall level. There is gold in the game in the form of coins that can be spent at the merchant, but the prices are too imbalanced in comparison with what they give for obtaining the level. This can be fixed with a mod, but the feelings are not the same. 4. Bagany time counter. This goes for the part where you speed up time. For example, in order to quickly get resources from the other end of the map, you put a port, speed up the time, and then return it to x1, but the portal still counts as x2 acceleration. The game was released a long time ago, but the bugs remained. I will not call the add-ons a minus, but I would not lay out the amount as for 2 games in general only for the add-ons (this is briefly about the add-ons, they are not worth it). If the developers had corrected at least the first 2 points, then I would have happily played it, and so it looks more like a clone of another game, only with a lot of additional funds for getting all the content from the players.

{"text" : "From the very first minutes of the game, you notice that the developer was inspired by such famous games about the end of the world as S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and METRO. Heat Guardian is a Top Down shooter set in a nuclear winter. In fact, the game created a mixed impression of all the acting. I give a negative review due to some flaws and illogicality. I will explain all this further. Performed in this product, as well as to match other games of this genre, but adjusted for the cold winter setting, the presence of a Survival mechanic (Collecting firewood on the way to the destination so as not to freeze, collecting cartridges, first-aid kits and vodka with the need for their widespread use) ... There are only three opponents - two mutants and marauders. There are a lot of weapons in the game, there will be an abundance of ammunition, quite enough to pacify the representatives of the local fauna. 1) Perhaps the first thing that caused criticism was bugs. More precisely, one single bug, but maddeningly disgusting. The bottom line is that bringing the cursor closer to the character (when trying, say, to pick up an object), this very cursor bounces away from the character, which makes it difficult, if not impossible, to select items, thereby, you risk dying prematurely. 2) The next thing that caused .... If not a censure, then at least a misunderstanding is the abundance of weapons with an extremely small number of opponents. Really. Yes, the game follows the canon of the genre, where the player has many different weapons at his disposal, but the problem is that this very weapon cannot be used for its intended purpose due to the absence of any hostile living creatures, and the problem is that of all this variety, only a few weapons have a share of practical significance. On the example of, say, Hotline Miami - a classic example of a dynamic Top Down shooter, a reasonable point of view is formed in the minds of players that if there are many opponents, then the number of weapons should match them. The peculiarity of HM is that absolutely all weapons can be used there and absolutely all weapons used will have practical benefits. "But this is a game in a harsh winter setting, with a hostile world!" I agree, only the hostile and harsh world of nuclear winter is not so harsh. Really. This problem could be solved by increasing the number of individuals in the already meager bestiary, or by adding new individuals. 3) Dialogues. Meager, boring dialogues that do not reveal the lore of the game in any way, and to this is added another problem - no less meager narrative: in the course of the game, the character will find various documents, however, they do not have any content, except for photographs until the moment of the disaster - no more. 4) Locations. Let's just say that the design of the locations does not give rise to serious complaints from me. Objectively, each location is a route from point A to point B, where the duration of this route is explained by the relief, or by strikes with few opponents. Adding NPCs (Enough even in a single copy) and side quests would dilute the routine wandering around the locations and bring interest to the gameplay. I consider the sound accompaniment in the game to be its strong point, albeit not deprived of a share of contradiction. The sounds of the gunfire are great, and the music is equally great to enhance the atmosphere. Of course, borrowings are felt here as well, since the soundtrack is similar in sound to the works of Alexey Omelchuk (Composer STALKER and METRO), but the music itself is quite pleasant. I can also refer to the strengths of the graphics and design of locations - the design of the premises, the presence of an isometric projection, which makes it easy to view these premises. For fun, I got acquainted with the creators of the game. More precisely, the creator. This game was made by one person, who was periodically helped by other people (for example, in terms of music), and I think, in general, not a bad job with enormous potential, but so far, the project is not devoid of a number of shortcomings that, of course, need to be corrected.

{"text" : "It's bad that the incentive cannot rate the game with points, and not just like or dislike. In short, a company is a bang bang, a waste. Press F to honor the memory. Everything is in the style of witchcraft, no innovations happened. Adding exoskeletons adds a certain amount of variety (press and hold F to slowly descend from a great height), but it does not make a revolution. Multiplayer new perks, weapons, modules and, of course, customization of the exoskeleton. But the biggest disadvantage that wanders from game to game is the very principle of multiplayer operation, that is, the "player is the host" and other nibbers are connected to it, if the Internet crashes for that main scam or it just rains, it switches to an alternative host played before I understood perfectly about what I). Occasionally, at the very beginning of the game, a break occurs, it would seem that we have already loaded, go go go and then bang disconnect, and back to the menu. This crap is only present on PC and PS4. On Xbox, it was paid for by microsoft, they say the priority platform and they provide servers in Germany, as a result, this never happens to them, and a stable ping of ~ 45 (from Belarus). By the way, DLCs come out there much earlier than for us. It's a shame, the consoles are a priority. Give dedicated servers and Server Browser, as it was in MW, BO and MW3! Then we would see, for example, "Promod" and "Snipers Only" servers and a lot of fan mods ... Probably could not have done without "[PL] Fast farm x2015 XP" ... The graphics component in the game is good, which cannot be said about the voice acting of the Russian localizer ... It is terrible, it feels like it was voiced by one person, then just processed the voice in Sony - Sound Forge ... But there is an opportunity to angloify the game by manipulating files and get the original spell, as it was made by Sledgehammer Games.

Elementary after loading the map, when it would seem that the "Synchronization of parameters" and "Waiting for other players" should already begin, this does not happen, but simply hangs for 30 seconds and then throws everyone out in the lobby ... games are happening. There is also nonsense in terms of physics, in flight you can clamp it and there is absolutely no recoil. And also, in comparison with the previous parts, in this one you need to "squeeze" more cartridges to kill (~ 10 instead of ~ 5). In general, MW1 / 2/3 / BO2 is much better than this one. update 11/21/2014 The most beastly multiplayer of all parts of the code (bugs and gameplay). Even MSR and alternatives to the usual AWP like in MW1 / 2/3 BO were not in this game. The profile can be hacked by the way so as not to fight with 15 prestiges. The fact that they added an "Alternative Color Scheme" doesn't make up for those times. Serfs who consider this part to be much better than the previous ones, you are simply eblans who have not played MW1 / 2. You will never see something like this in this guinea: "}
{"text" : "Fucking shit. More precisely, shit made from xyyni. Or xyynya made of govna. To say that I burned to the ground is to say nothing. The incentive is actually a very specific rating system. In reality, anything that has an overall rating lower than "very positive" (ideally "extremely" is better) are xye gradations. It is a fact. There will always be a sufficient number of fanboys and just dolboebs putting their thumbs up for, for example, cards. That is, the fact that her reviews were simply "positive" - ​​alerted immediately. But I decided to give a chance - like, suddenly everything is really not so bad. Yeah, naxyй. It's just rubbish. Everything is wooden, including the fucking main character and his motives. The plot seemed to be written by a second grader. Although perhaps even he would have written better than the justified rihanna pratchid. Seriously blyad '(uuuuh, cyka, how I hate the fucking steam for this censorship) - fucking Garrett goes to business with a whore, then SOMETHING happens and it turns off and turns on in a year. Where has he been this year? He was rescued by beggars and kept in a safe place. What for? Simple. Just like that blyad. ' Aaaaaaa, yet. Delivering him back to the city, two beggars yebka selflessly sacrificed their lives just to bring him a little closer to home. In the sense - naturally, so that he was not two hundred meters from the house, but in, say, one hundred and fifty - both died with a smile on their lips. Naes. And then it will be so everywhere. The plot is presented approximately with the degree of reliability of the play about Masha and the Bears in the puppet theater. I don’t have enough words to describe the xyeness of all this xyini. I was not surprised when I realized that the role of the main antagonist would be a general with a head in the form of a cheerleader and a movie of the level of Bollywood fighters. Nice is everything. Oxyenno. More from the oxyenny moments. Periodically, it doesn’t jump where it should, for example. Where it is impossible to jump, it doesn’t jump either way. But it dulls also in specially designated places. I went into a tavern. There are several people, in pairs, one at a time - like talking. Only they stand in silence, look at you and periodically move their hands. Quite cryptic xyynya, really. Well, the very performance of such a govna is the same blyad 'level of the 99th year and that, in the game, it was not first class at that time. Everything is super lifeless and dead. The game was really scored xy. And the decanter? What about animations? It's just blyad 'pizdec. Ebony dummies are worse than in the Polish mid-2000s shooter. But this is AAA, fuck him in the mouth, 2014 year naxy. What the hell. Moreover, the decanter of houses-premises-all xyini is generally normal, in places it is even imperceptible that it is ye3. But people blyad '... It's just something. As if straight from the presets of the 3D editor, without finishing. During the day I walked through one level, which, in theory, is designed for a maximum of an hour, and even then reluctantly and constantly looking at the video passage - so much in the whole situation shown to me it was even possible to think. Interrogated essentially for some fucking experiment, lol. And, of course, in vain. It was the most boring and xye game I've played in real life in the last three years, if blyad 'not 10, kek. Perhaps she would have competitors, but usually I obviously did drop naxy and it moved either to the shield folder in the incentive, or to the trash. And then Chot KILLED. I'm sorry about the time. Super parasha on which the developers just hammered xy. And this ending ... This is something. I read read about his badness - but I did not expect THIS. Seriously, I just don't have any blyad 'words. Not even the "super xyita" nyxyya can describe this ebony. It's just the WORST I've seen in games at all. Even the passing products of the 98th year of release, which at one time received 5 points out of 10 from the surveyors, were perhaps better. Wild axy. This rubbish. It's better to forget about it as soon as possible, otherwise I'm sitting with an elongated ebola and pursed lips from pxyenia. Can't recommend to anyone, never and never. It's super trash. Imperfection. The game for which for some reason was developed was hammered xy. "}

But at Ubisoft there are clever ones because you can configure everything. If you don't have an Xbox 360 controller, the analog controls are set in the "gamepad" category while the buttons are set in the "steering wheel" category.

Also if this was only for the backers, how did it get out to the public, it's their own fault and they have nobody but themselves to blame. It's going to be a long road for this game and maybe possibly in the future the game will change my perspective on how I feel about the game.

{"text" : "Today it makes no sense to buy this game, even for review. The fact is that there is nothing in it that can delay you for more than 20-30 minutes. There is no sound in the game; there is only one mountain available, on which you ride alone. Only one ski is present. But there are a lot of suits, jackets, gloves, masks, skis paintwork and other similar junk. I really hope that the developers will bring to mind the game, because, in principle, you can make a high-quality descendant of the old Shaun White Snowboarding out of it. Later I will most likely (99%) change my mind, but for now I do not recommend that you buy and play this beta. Update 02/17/2014 Sadly, but almost nothing has changed. There is still no sound in the game! The mechanics of the skier's behavior remained the same wooden. Added a new mountain, removing the old (!), New suits and skis (as if they had nothing else to do) and still did not introduce snowboard. There was also a game in co-op, but the lobby can only be created by yourself and it is impossible to enter into something already created by someone, a paradox. In general, the game still leaves a lot to be desired. Update 10/16/2014 To be honest, I completely forgot about this game, but today it is not clear why I decided to download and see what's new. First, about the pros, the sound finally appeared in the game. And not just music on the menu, but the voice acting of everything that (I hope) is still present in the game. Oddly enough, this is where the pros end and the minuses begin again. It is probably worth starting with the in-game store, in which the player can buy some items for the character of the game, although there are free ones in bulk (it seems that the developers know how to do this best). The question is for what? The game is still raw to the point of indecency, but they have already made an in-game store. Although they may simply not have enough money for the update. I'm not to judge. The second point is skier mechanics. It is still the same wooden. Controlling the hero is inconvenient, jumping is inconvenient, any fall from skis is fatal (you cannot, for example, take them off and just walk on foot as it was in SWS). The only fun thing is to watch the skier's carcass flying down the cliff down the mountain. By the way, I noticed a bug, if you go backwards, it doesn't matter what you hit, you will never fall to the ground. Skis, by the way, generally seem to have a built-in perpetual motion machine, that is, it does not matter whether you are driving directly or from a slope, on ice or snow, on stones or asphalt - the speed is the same everywhere (slightly faster off the slope). How is this to be understood? Push off as much as possible from a place and pick up speed while standing on the asphalt. There is absolutely no atmosphere in the game, they could at least add bots. Because the game has potential and it is not clear why no one wants to reveal it. The game is still raw and still not worth playing. Wouldn't recommend. And by the way, she's almost a year old. And this year, the developers have added sound, an in-game store and an over9000 hats. We replaced one mountain with another and created a non-working lobby. A year ago I wrote that I would most likely change my mind, but apparently the developers managed to screw up the project and get into that 1%. Update 12/18/2014 Now it seems to me that the developers are just trolls (or they are idiots). After the last update, the game began to freeze, so much so that it cannot be turned off through the "Task Manager" and only restarting the computer saves. Otherwise, everything is the same. The mountain is the same, there is still no multiplayer, not even bots. The developers of this game, apparently, are still autistic, since they force the players to ride on this mountain alone. But cosmetic changes were made, an intro appeared when the game was launched, and the interface was also slightly changed. The question remains the same, why do we need this, if the game is still not interesting. Update 02/05/2016 Two years after the release, the game has got a laggy multiplayer for 12 people. It's still boring to play, the world is still boring and lifeless. There are no tournaments, no competitions, or any other sporting events between the players, 12 autistic people just travel through the mountains. Unbridled joy. Snowboarding has not yet been introduced, and the control of the hero is still clumsy and inconvenient. P.S. I'm a crazy fan of snowboarding. "}

{"text" : "I have been playing a very similar game from the same creator since 2006, specifically Netsoccer 1 and later another improved version called Netsoccer 2, this game has many similarities with those games although it also has important differences, so as not to make it very extensive I step to highlight the pros and cons of the game: Pros: ------ - It's addictive, as soon as you learn to play you want to play a game and another game and another game ... it is clear that it is a game to which if you get the hang of it, you go to want to play a lot. - Accustomed in the previous versions to always match 5 players to be able to play the truth is that having so many people online and the possibility of playing at almost any time of the day is appreciated, it is a plus that only the people who come from the other game understand. - The menus are intuitive, you can create your own team, distribute within the same different levels (owner, master, admin and player), it has a section on competitions that I understand will be polishing ... for now things look good in this regard . You have statistics for both teams and players. - Very simple controls, I always recommend the mouse, with the mouse and the "a" key to mow you no longer need more. Cons -------- - The lag, that the main thing, is improving but it is a big problem. - I'm sorry but I'm not going to pay 7 euros for 3 months of VIP, I still remember paying 12 euros for a year in the other game. - Very slow, it would be much more fun if the players were faster. - There should be some learning mode, an in-game tutorial for new players. - The BOTS, although people who have little say they are good, they are absurd and they break the dynamics of the game a lot, I would clearly change it for a minimum of human players removing the bots. I emphasize, they are not good, there are many tricks to avoid them in attack. - The bugs, there are several, such as centering the first post from the corner, it is always a goal if you position yourself well. - The goalkeeper is quite useless, if you learn to shoot from a place 95% of the shots are goals. - If you play against a VIP and you are not a VIP you are lost, currently in that aspect it is a very clear pay to win. At the graphic level I do not comment on anything since it fulfills its mission, the main thing is the gameplay, the same sound ... In summary, do not pretend to enter and start "enjoying", it is a game that seems simple but needs a lot of practice to enjoy it, I recommend training a lot and playing games against friends to get the hang of it. You can ask me for help and advice within the game, I have no problems about it, quite a few people have already asked me. Do I recommend it? For now, since I have faith in its creator, I have known him for many years and I hope that he will launch updates and polish all the problems. Give it a try and don't give up, it's a matter of practice and above all patience. ANALYSIS EDIT - The developer has closed the game, it does not load without prior notice ... something totally unexpected and more when there are people who have paid the VIP and it is not known what has happened with their money ... obviously change to NOT RECOMMENDED by the null evolution in game updates and for closing it in this way.

{"text" : "I purchased   as part of a game bundle in December 2015. As such, it was extremely inexpensive, and that is fortunate. The game is inexpensive even at full price, but that is almost its only redeeming quality. I will also say that it is quite colorful, but the game is so bad that I could only play for about 5 minutes.  The controls are very bad and there appears to be nothing that you can actually do. If you attempt to travel much beyond where you begin, you get a message stating "this area is unavailable in Alpha", which is akin to the "under construction" message occasionally encountered on websites. This is a recipe for almost certain failure. Upon attempting to exit the game, I could only do so by forcing with Ctrl+Alt+Del. The developer ( ) has stated: After some explanation stating attempts to "find investor and hire people" had failed, a plug for a new game was presented, stating: It is unacceptable to expect financial support from consumers for multiple games which can barely claim to be in Alpha access.

{"text" : "I can see why people enjoy this game, but it's not my cup of tea.. and here's why. I have around three hours of experience in this game, which is enough to make a review. The game's literal goal is to not get killed. This means you can win by camping or killing everyone else. But here's the fun part, the play area gets decreased over time. the players outside of the play area will receive damage over time, this means they have to rush inside the play area otherwise they'll die. The concept is pretty simple, but why does it have such a large playerbase? I think because it's a great game to play with friends. It's fun to team up and plan strategies to eliminate the enemies. Also the game's world is very big, which makes it pretty cool. This means no game is the same because you will be playing on different locations. So why am i not recommending this game? I think the concept of the game is pretty cool. But i cannot stand the game mechanics. The aiming is terrible and so is the way you shoot your guns. It's all very clunky, maybe because i am used to playing CS and Quake and stuff but still.. Another thing that is really annoying is the way parachutes work in this game, once you are close to the ground with the parachute you will slow down so extremely much everyone will know where you have landed. (Please take some notes from the Just cause series). Also i think the game is way overpriced. $30 is nowhere near the value of this game, $15 would be more reasonable. Conclusion: Wait for it to go on sale, it's not worth $30. "}

{"text" : "Here's a real review for this game! I thought that this part would make a splash of impressions and a lot of positive emotions, but it was not there ... I even returned the money from the pre-order. Unfortunately, I cannot say something good about this game, since I already wrote a review about FC4, and FC5, in my opinion, turned out to be another Yubisoft pipeline. Even when compared with the previous part of FC4, it was noticeably more colorful and brighter in comparison with this part. This is not to say that a lot of new things have appeared here, absolutely impossible! And the one who will argue and beat himself in the chest trying to prove that I am wrong, just played little in the previous parts of this series. We tightened the graphics, but the engine remained old, the plot does not catch on, and at some point you can understand that you have already seen such a plot in some old American film (remembering approximate excerpts from this film, the plot will be clear to the pain in your chest ), oh, even without watching that old movie, you can guess how it will develop, it's banal, but for some it's a class and mega-fantasy. There is also a remark that cannot be catchy and not ignored, and what do you think it is?) These are flags, flags hang everywhere and on everything, if it is not in the 1st house, then in the 2nd house it will be simply hung with them , they will hang on the flagpole, in the house there will still be posts on the walls and, of course, miniature flags that are placed on the table as decorative for the house, I was surprised to see such a large abundance of flags of a foreign country, which by the way repels (no, I'm not a patriot) , but to constantly observe the flag of this country, as much as I would not like, they will be everywhere and everywhere, just know this. The thought jumps over that for every flag I see and, in general, everyone who plays this game, this is some kind of price policy within this country, if you show the flag, then you will receive a discount in the form (??%) on VAT on game sales, for example, speech it is about big numbers in fact. The world and its surroundings, the map is large and there is a lot of different things on it, but it still doesn’t touch to spend there tens or hundreds of hours exploring it. In particular, I buy games to play with friends and those whom I do not know, but this is not a game in which there is some freedom of action, everything is the same as it was before. The gameplay itself remained approximately the same as in the previous parts, but the way he holds the weapon in his hands slightly annoyed me, the very position of how he holds it makes it feel like I'm not holding an assault rifle, but it's unclear what, why it is so low ?! Weapons can be seen somewhere by 40%, well, lan maybe 50%, the rest is not visible, we play a first-person shooter where weapons are hidden, I really like looking at the barrels and when I hold them in my hand I want to feel it, feel and, most importantly, SEE IT, how it behaves when shooting, imbued with its recoil when shooting, motor skills, etc. It is strange that this is not observed with pistols and submachine guns, well, maybe there is such a thing with snaps, though I did not have time to pick them up ...

I did not plant a single plant; another person was engaged in it. Sometimes he fished, but mostly ran into caves in search of something unusual. But I didn't last long. I didn’t have a puppy thrill of playing. Visually, of course, she is incomparable. But the process itself is rather boring and monotonous. At first it seems that there is a lot of variety in the game, but then this variety turns into a burden and with each launch of the game, I less and less wanted to be there. I liked the moment with, they send you letters, talk to you about this and that, make friends with them and you can even ring. But only there is both joy and disgust in this. Earned hearts for gifts to those who wanted to please? Be ready to talk to them constantly, for the hearts will go away. Okay, everything would be fine, only you will just waste all the playing time on this, because: - the houses in which they live work from 9:00, and you wake up at 6:00 - not all characters let you into their house , so you have to wait for them to come out - some characters leave their room only at 11:00 or 12:00 - they roam all over the city, and they are not visible on the map Of course, I did not do this. So what was I doing? Yes, in fact - I was bored. 50 hours of boredom and routine that doesn't sound like chiiiiiiil at all. The system of swinging the sword and pickaxe is just awful. The character always beats in the wrong direction. Hold LMB to swing a sword? The game is full of details and this is a big plus, but something more is missing. There is a lack of some kind of plot, variety. The world is very small, which surprised me. You can get to one location only for money or to craft a teleport, but the recipe for the teleport itself is very idiotic. At first, you wonder how many events there are in the game - different quests, change of seasons, holidays. But only everything is repeated, the same thing. At the beginning of the game, some actions take place, you quickly do them and wait for new drops, but they are not. Just drive in the mine, fish and plant beds ... "}

And here - you run around with a shitty arrow that does no damage, if you find a very rarely falling key or buy it - you open a box with a random weapon, which can be full of rubbish - and that's it, there are no more modifications, replay value is about zero.

In short - initially there was a summer card, with practically no bushes, low requirements and a completely playable product with great prospects and hopes, without emphasis on donation and any cases, then everything moved to steam on a new graphon, on a winter map, with new features and much higher requirements, but still keeping the origins ... as a result, with a completely different gameplay and dynamics, it all turned into handicraft wars with a cool grafon, a cool story regarding the convergence of the zone and no less cool graphic component of this business, with cases and significantly higher requirements for hardware, and it seems like progress on the face ... but for some reason the desire to play all the innovations and updates was killed completely. And more ... I started playing ROE (or Europa) on Thai servers with a rather severe ping (it was almost impossible to use transport), but it was fun and interesting, because according to the requirements, it was many times lighter than a pubg and my laptop carried this business quite well for myself, the graphics were square in places, but still pleasing to the eye, except that the physics of the machines left much to be desired, but, nevertheless, the sensations from shooting and movement in general were very positive ... then there was only one map - summer ... the landing was on gliders, and there were no airdrops at all))) Then they brought in the calamus and igrulya took on a new breath ... it doesn't matter, but the atmosphere was very different from the pubg and everything worked out easy, there were a lot of hopes for development, they promised to finish the schedule too ... however, with the next new thing, the graphon, the map, and at the same time the lags arrived ... on Steam ... But already on Steam, not a trace of the original map remained ... a winter map appeared ... the spawn method also changed - I chose a point and spawned (while loot spawned at the same time rarely when I agreed 8)) , cool features appeared according to the map, type and a board, hooks and a personal glider ... a blizzard, which had a striking effect on the requirements for the hardware and the laptop I had already refused to carry this business ... the new mechanics of course pleased me, but the picture as a whole was not, because I wanted so much to go to my native map and play, but the game is not at all the same ... and it's not about the hardware, as someone might have assumed, I continued to play at the computer, but the game was no longer the same - a huge amount of vegetation, a new weapon, which, with the old mechanics, in new realities, plays out and looks completely wretched and unnatural in comparison with what it was before.

{"text" : "I had a lot of complaints about. It just so happened that I used to associate Call of Duty games with a good storyline (the last games played in the series: Black ops 2 and MW3). I didn't see that here. Sometimes, from the absurdity of what was happening on the screen, I wanted to pierce the monitor through, but I held back as best I could. , in my opinion, is also complete nonsense. From the middle, I just tried to skip all the cut-scenes as much as possible and run through the levels as soon as possible. I'm especially tired of. I'll tell you a little story. Once I decided to go through this masterpiece at the maximum difficulty level. I was ready for anything, since I had already played World at War and MW2 on a "veteran". Everything went smoothly until at one of the levels I noticed that the opponents simply did not end, no matter how much I shot them. In the end, I realized that some places (and even levels) you just need to run through, which is quite difficult to do at the maximum level. But that's not all! Very often, the AI ​​insolently camped me and did not allow me to lean out from behind the shelter. “This is the maximum difficulty,” you say. I could agree, but the AI ​​did it when I entered from the back or from the side, where no one was supposed to wait for me. And it happened like this: I run to the side door, where there is no one to get around the enemy; if they kill me, then after the revival the enemy is already waiting for me there, although before that there was no one there. I can't calculate exactly how many times I rolled my eyes and cursed my opponent, but, believe me, this happened often. Setting aside the plot and treating the game as in the spirit of the good old films with Schwarzenegger and Stallone, then perhaps the game is to your taste. There is a huge number of explosions, screams, explosions again, and, in principle, spectacular moments. That's what the game is definitely worth praising for. Although I played it a little, I really liked it and pulled it on for a while (I'm not a fan of online mode in CoD). It has quite a lot of interesting modes, different types of weapons and a variety of chips. At one time I liked it even more than the online mode in my favorite MW2. I don't know what this is connected with: either with a more convenient weapon, or the atmosphere was more hooked. At the moment, online is slowly dying, although there are still fierce battles in most modes. "}

You can only have one of 2 characters (Native American, both male and female), any others you can see in the photo or video, which you have to buy with real money, as well as bindings and clothes (you may be able to get them later in the game without buying it, but I won't play it that long to see if you can). There is even a classic f2p mechanic to log in every day to receive a reward. I wouldn't mind all this if the game was actually free. Or if they did put a price on it because they feared they wouldn't get any money in the beginning from in-game sales, then okay, but reward the buyer with something like premium money or another character of their choice (3 or besides, you will be available for this). Just do something. "}

{"text" : "In short, SOMA is a badly told good story. And whatever "Extremely positive" reviews she has, achievements speak eloquently about her: less than 50% of players reached the middle, but only 29.5% reached the end. In more detail, there are only two Twists as such in the game, one is revealed to us in the first third of the game (unless, of course, you are a complete brake), but the second is read once or twice and the line connected with it seems to be broken off. It can be seen that the scriptwriter (s) tried (were), but either the experience was not enough, or the patience ... At the expense of the horror component. I belong to the type of people who are scared not so much by screamers or sounds as by the unknown in the question "what will they scare us with?", And as soon as the creators demonstrate all their tricks, the fear disappears. In SOMA, the fear disappeared after the first "robostraus" or whoever he was, and this is the very beginning for a second. To a greater extent, this was facilitated by the absence of consequences as such, being caught, you do not start the game from the beginning of the location and do not lose progress, but simply continue on your way with a slight limp for a couple of seconds. During the entire game, I died 3 times, and 3 out of 3 - due to my own inattention and desire to quickly pass the game. Either I jump into the pit tired of looking for a move, then I get lost in the monotonous corridors ... To the first "humanoid" opponents, you understand that they don't have any AI as such, it's just a script, and it's just not interesting to play. Completed the game in 4 hours, after the first 1,% of hours played with the thought "But when will this end then, eh ?!". I think SOMA is a highly overpriced product. Cut the price tag in 2 times and you can take it, in other cases, just go to the achievements and check the percentage of those who have passed the game by 100% ... With the current price tag of 4 out of 10, just for efforts (although not a fact, masking texture curves with darkness is such a diligence) ... "}

Also, you can buy a fake royal stamp from a criminal named Snake that permits you to sell the human meat to the innkeeper, who then presumedly feeds it to his clients.  Doesn't seem to care what KIND of meat it is, except its a delicacy I haven't gotten far but already I like this game in a bad sense of conscience I played this game to completion and I have to give it a thumbs down.  It's not so much that it's Unfinished, but by the time the story and game ended, there was literally no point in building up your graveyard.  I still had like 75% of the graveyard to fill with graves and I went to all the trouble to have the highest quality graves as I could(marble statues, grave stones, 9-10 skull corpses).  But then the game just ends, the only goal it asks of you is like a 200 point rating and I had way over that and had barely started.  Its frustrating that it can be so fun and seem like such an engrossing game to develop your land, much like Stardew Valley, then it just ends and there was no point to begin with.  Unfinished? Yes.  Lack of Goals, yes.  Theres not even steam achievements related to the whole focal point of the game, your graveyard I have not tried the expansion due to this.  From what I could see they did not remedy this bleak situation and just added a bunch of new stuff. "}

{"text" : "Usually it's rare for me to even review anything, but this game is so damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful I had to write this. I don't have as much playtime as the so called "high rank" players but honestly the opinion won't change much. I played the game since it's late beta days and since then I never really grinded or tried to get any ranks, until a few months ago. I was enjoying matchmaking until a bunch of spammers started queueing up with me, if there's anything that makes this game AWFUL it's most likely the fact that the champions are NOT BALANCED at all. The offline/casual gameplay is overall pretty decent, but the fact that people who are trying to grind for ranks using their actual skill can't because of the unbalanced champions ruins it all. Making a list of the actual unbalanced champions would be unnecessary since the whole community knows them pretty well. Thanks for reading the review and please stop ruining others matches X) "}

{"text" : "Absolutely no way! I bought the game in the hope of getting a relatively bug-free simulator. and - who could have expected - I was disappointed. - The really worst are the exaggeratedly loud, totally overdriven sounds. After accepting or completing a mission, there is a loud, bass-heavy "BING" that you will hammer your way through the next day. Apart from that, the car sounds like a mix of leaf blower, garden chopper and motor scooter ... (You can thank Sven Gerlach for this, he even has its own page). If you think you could dim this a bit via the audio settings, you cut yourself;) - The eternal problem, players have had the opportunity to admire their mouse cursor over the game for 3 years. If that weren't a trigger enough, then the intensity of the mouse speed can also be adjusted under the game, in different situations. So, either the camera moves in-game in slow motion, or you can look around your character a full 10 times with a centimeter on the mouse pad ... - Other road users apparently do not know the right-hand drive law, sometimes remain completely unpredictable on the motorway or on theirs Driveways stand, the result? - You are allowed to teleport yourself to another rest stop by fast travel so that you don't get stuck between other cars on a narrow motorway entrance. - Just get out of the car in the 1st person, then not only do you no longer have a game character, but you can suddenly push cars around like Hulk, then the same thing happens to you as I do, and you move your police car and get back in , you can watch yourself spinning in mid-air across the world. - Grumbling at a high level, but I was hoping you can control the "mobile speed cameras", which are actually stationary, yourself, as you know it, bum in a VW bus at the service station and deprive people of their money. - Vehicles can often not be stopped, at least with me (maybe I'm acting stupid), neither with the "Please follow" (in front of the suspect) nor as a "Please stop" (behind the suspect). But there are also pros for the game: + The game has many nice ways to interact with other drivers (if you can stop). + The game has a slightly tinged story mode, which makes tutorials seem appropriate in these situations. + A choice of day, night and early shift is possible, as well as 3 different emergency vehicles (5-series BMW emergency vehicle, VW bus, and a BMW as a civilian version. + In addition, the dialogues are amazingly good for a game of this kind.

{"text" : "I clarify in advance that this game was given to me by a friend, and I am sorry to value it negatively, but if it is bad I can do nothing. Need For Speed ​​is a terrible game, with ridiculous glitches and a bug-ridden setting. To begin with the slightest thing, the story; She's super silly, the characters are cartoons, I don't think there are real people who behave like that, it's ridiculous (Except Manu, I like you ♥♥♥♥♥), you run races to show that you are the coolest thing in the world. In the city, the events are divided into categories, one for each character in the story, but in practice you will only do circuits, drag races, drift and sprin, and from the police ... they are non-existent they are reduced to an epileptic light on the screen, helicopter ? Nails? Heavy trucks? No, nothing like that. The on-screen presentation is very good, although the whole game is nocturnal, so they can give more details to what can be seen, the photo mode is tremendous, the audio complies, although there is no dubbing into Latin Spanish and the soundtrack stands out for not standing out at all. Now the biggest shit in the game; the handling, like me, EA couldn't beat 2010's Hot Pursuit, with its (for the time) groundbreaking drift handling easy to do with a light touch on the brake or releasing the throttle, something that worked perfectly in this game thanks to its wide fairways, medium and open curves. This installment uses that same handling system, and it shows that they have learned something, since, despite being an urban environment, many curves are sinusoidal and sharp or angular curves are rare, but it still feels rough and imprecise, Failure to enter or exit curves is very common, this is something that in my opinion ruined Most Wanted of 2012, its urban environment with narrow streets and tight curves did not adapt well to said mechanics. They tried to innovate with the driving styles, drift or grip… and I don't know what they did it for, grip penalizes drifts, doing them is more difficult, and drifting is like the best way to play, it penalizes little. But here it fails, it is frequent that just when leaving a skid the direction is blocked and it takes hold late, that surely happens in a simulation, but this is an arcade game, the nitro many times does not work and it is necessary to insist with the button. This poor handling is linked to a technical problem, when repeating an event a lot the game crashes. The worst: the edges at the edges of the curves, there are bad unions in the polygons that form the inside and outside of the curves (that's what I think happens, but it could be something else), and apparently the car's hitbox is a cube, this makes what should be a slight scratch of the car against the outside or inside of the curve, (due to understeer or oversteer) to become a noisy accident, where by the way they recycle the crash animations of the NFS The Run , animations that play a while after the crash and that take you to a mini loading screen, which would be tolerable if it were like in The Run, which returned you to the previous checkpoint, but no, it throws you on the track, even in unfavorable conditions where you can crash again, this game is a parody. And what led me to write this negative review, the game requires a permanent internet connection for everything, no matter how you play you must be connected, but even if you have good internet, they can take you out because EA's servers cannot with 12 users connected (if it has servers, it looks like p2p) and if you have an unstable connection the game will also take you out, wherever you are. A pity because this game carried the responsibility of being the restart of the franchise, but they accelerated a lot and ended up with the engine burned, an engine that by the way is complete crap, if there is one thing I remember Frostbite it is for ruining games and entire franchises. The game has good ideas, the dramatic camera angles when drifting, the graphics are actually good, even now, the silly story has some great personalities from the automotive world, the online mode is fun, but There you will see if not, since you have to play connected to the internet yes or yes. It could be a great reboot for the franchise, but it stayed as a mediocre video game, I no longer think this will improve, that's how it will stay, it hurts. "}

{"text" : "Had to refund this mess. I simply couldn't enjoy it. Let's see why... It is literally a jack of all trades. "What do you mean by that!?" Simply that it has all of the aspects that make a great and immersive VR game....The problem is that those aspects are implemented extremely poorly. Let me give some examples: Melee combat: Raw Data VR specializes in this, and does it exceedingly well. If your draw to Skyrim VR was the potential for melee combat? Then I suggest Raw Data instead. It's a futuristic game, true, but the melee truly is astoundingly fun(albeit a bit motion sickening if you go overboard) Magic: A Mage's Tale specializes in this, and does it exceedingly well. If your draw to Skyrim VR was the potential for immersive magic, then I suggest A Mage's Tale instead. It's set in a 'similar' era as Skyrim, making it quite enjoyable as an alternative with truly exceptional controls, compared to the very uninspired nonsense that you'll find here. Archery: In Death specializes in this, and does it exceedingly well. If your draw to Skyrim VR was the potential for becoming an expert marksman sniper, then I suggest In Death instead. It plays more like a 'crucible' game...getting from Point A to Point B without dying, and if you complete it, you get moved to the next difficulty level, and so on, until you die. It might sound simplistic, and shallow to some, but trust me, it is a source of several hours of truly fun gameplay. And best of all, the controls are easy on your motion sickness, if you have it, meaning you can play it safely for hours. Stealth: Unknightly specializes in this, and does it exceedingly well. If your draw to Skyrim VR was the potential for remaining undetected and killing quietly, then I suggest Unknightly instead. Long story short? Skyrim is demanding $60 for trying to fit all of the niche requirements for good VR games, into one, and doing it extremely poorly and with absolutely zero inspiration. Save your money, and pick 2-3 of the above preferences, and find a game that suits that need. "}

It's not just the size of the text (oo-er, that's what she said) that is the issue, but the font as well.  but that's is not what let's the game down the most. What leaves me totally unable to recommend the game are the controls. They are some of the worst controls I have ever had the displeasure to use in a game. They are so unnecessarily complicated and convoluted, I was left to wonder if the developers decided to make the controls the difficulty in the game, rather than worry about A.I. and terrain causing issues.  This causes the game to end up as a terrible copy of 'Worms' where every get's to go at once, but nobody knows how to move their avatar properly, almost discovering how to, before inevitably using a jet-pack to flail about for a few seconds, before plummeting face first in to an explosive item laying innocently on the floor.

The interactive cut scenes where you have to click on the correct object instead of playing solitaire, are ridiculously easy, and completely pointless.

{"text" : "This game is reviewed by a person who has never played Life Is Feudal. Steam Hammer is a game that looks similar to Rust, but with graphics that doesn’t look decent and without any animals to hunt. The game has many fps Drops that makes my head hurt. When I first started the game, I thought that it would be a great game because of the intro that was shown at the begin. But it wasn’t, after I joined a server and created a character the game changed my thoughts. Actually I wanted a female character, but it wasn’t available yet. I started in a rainy day the game which made my head hurts, because of the many fps drops and the indecent modern graphics. I started with bare hands in a deserted area in the island nearby the territory of the Liandri. The game gets boring even after some minutes of playing, because the only things I did was to run like a maniac who didn’t knew what to do. The game needs a tutorial that shows how to play the game, for people who has never played Life Is Feudal. Only one of the good perspectives of the game is that there are many variety of trees in the game(yes trees). Like: Walnut, silver fir, Hevea, Silkalyptus and the Pine trees. If you look at trees you can see its name, you can get a sprout and you can open a context menu to choose a skill where you can get xp for: farming, engineering and construction.  The idea of the game was good, to make the first hardcore survival game, but it lacks many disadvantages that make the game not worth it for the retail price of 28 euro. I hope the developers will fix its issues as I wrote above than the game Pros:  -	You can customize your character to make it the way you like -	The sound is well-made and fits perfectly the game Neutral: -	The graphics is neither good or bad (even with the highest graphics) Cons:  -	There aren’t enough players to fill up even one server (64 players) -	You can’t select the female character yet, it is unavailable. But it will come anytime soon. -	The game looks like a pre-alpha because there are too many bugs and glitches that makes it looks like the game is poorly made -	The game doesn’t have a stable frames per second, the fps decreases from 30 to 26 to 21 and then comes back to      30.

There are technical flaws that glare out like putting a full clip of 5 bullets into a Kar98K despite the clip not being fully used.  There are ideological flaws like the lootbox system on the battlefield of the bloodiest war in history. There's a forced stance on political correctness that let black women on the battlefield of Normandy's infamous D-Day.  The graphics look like they're straight out of xbox. It feels more like an older title than a new AAA one. I could go on and on about this, but I don't think there's much use in beating a dead horse. It's probably my fault for having high hopes anyways.  Also, if you want to play the zombies mode, you have to download the multiplayer which is an additional 25 or so GB download. The only real saving grace is the zombies mode, but I don't think it's quite worth my money's worth to get a whole CoD game just for the zombies. I really have no words to conclude on my review. It's just disappointment and sadness. I can't recommend this game.  Bye call of duty. Looks like my dream of having a polished World at War was just a dream after all. "}

{"text" : "I'm saying this from the bottom of my heart, this game is completely dead to me. I used to love TF2, that's why I ended up investing so much of my time into it. I originally created my Steam account for Team Fortress 2. It was once a good game, and perhaps one of the best games of all time! ... But, that's not the case anymore. This game is actively getting worse and the development team is taking steps in the wrong direction with each update they release. Meet Your Match was so terrible that a large portion of the community, that has been there for years, left. I personally chose to stick around and just play on community servers, now the community is getting so antsy and toxic waiting for an update that not even that is fun anymore. Team Fortress 2 used to be a game that had 4 major updates a year, one near the beginning of the year, one in the summer, one for Halloween, and one for Christmas. All of which added new creative ideas to the game. Now we get one major update, one community made Halloween update and one lazy/community made Christmas update. Not only are these updates most often lazy and add no real new content, but they also ship broken more often than not, with untested balance changes and changes to gamemodes that make them borderline unplayable. Last year's Halloween update, for example, released with a bug that wouldn't allow you to complete contracts for 3 days, meaning that people couldn't get the new hats that were part of the update. The community has become absolute cancer. Every server is full of so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. SOO MANY, not only that but admins are now so bored waiting for the update that they're now banning people from community servers for a little bit of fun. Other people are hacking for 15 minutes of fun, just because everyone is waiting for an update, that will likely ship broken, that should have been released in January or February.  After 2000+ hours I can't stand to play this game anymore. I find myself getting angry at this game rather than enjoying it like I used to. I never got what people meant when they say TF2 is dead, but I understand now... This game has plenty of people playing it, but the care for the game is gone. This game is actually dead, the people who kept this game alive for so long are now leaving, and the people developing the game don't care about it anymore. Don't waste your time with this game. It's complete ♥♥♥♥ now. The way I'd describe it, TF2 is like that girlfriend that, even though your relationship is a bit rocky every once in a while, you'd never want to leave. Yet, though you want to support her as much as you can she starts taking drugs and progressively gets worse and worse, eventually prostituting herself for more and stronger drugs. Eventually have to leave her to see if she'll improve. That's what I'm doing... Sorry TF2, get your ♥♥♥♥ together and maybe I'll take you back eventually, but right now I don't want you. TF2 dev team, please just hand off this game to someone else. We all know that you don't care if this game dies off, but a lot of us do. "}

{"text" : "The game does not cost anything, and it is worth its price ... The content is extremely low: - One music in loop - 3 or 4 classic weapons - Not incredible enemies - Very short Gameplay level, Post Void generates levels in a way procedural (a basic tilemap at will) and the game boils down to moving forward by clicking to kill what we find in front of us. In our left hand: our health, which acts as a timer since we lose it as we go along. In our right hand: a gun Let's be honest: Post Void is nice, and takes a few tens of minutes from time to time, but its replayability is close to zero. Allow between 1 and 2 hours to complete it, after a good hundred runs. Once we understand how it works, we can almost play with our eyes closed. No really need to aim (headshots are taken into account, but the hitboxes are clearly messed up at times and make the game easy), no really need to think, it clears your head, it's funny, and it's very good like that. Little more: a world ranking to compare your scores, it's always nice, except that it doesn't work all the time, too bad! Big minus: The game is clearly made by one person with Game Maker (or something like that, I haven't been verified). It gives an optimized game with the feet (the minimum specs literally made me scream with laughter) On some runs I have had huge slowdowns, mainly when I abuse the shotgun and projectiles that bounce back. It gives the impression of playing in slow motion (or on a Pentium 2, maybe that's the goal? ...) In short: Post Void is falsely retro, it surfs on the "Hotline Miami" effect, and everyone cries out genius. For my part, I'm more mixed: it's a nice little game, it's worth its price, but certainly not a positive opinion. You will quickly get bored, buy it more as an experience, and not as a real game. "}

{"text" : "Review after playing almost 50 hours, and with the past game, in the absence of a few races of the hovercraft, hypercar and rally raid that gives me a lot of work to do and the missions to die of boredom from the photos, and if I pass all the bosses of each specialty, what happens is that buguisoft did not give me the trophy of the freestyle girl, and look that I played it 2 or 3 times. The Crew 2 is a game that attracts a lot of attention from the beginning, be it for its large scale map of the United States, for its many activities to do and its great diversity of vehicles. But it is a game that does not make me personally want to explore its map, not like what happened with the first the crew (played on ps4), the truth is that the only times I was free on the map in this game without doing anything was with motorcycles (both Harley, Ducati and BMV, which are the motorcycles that I have), but instead the first game if I explore more and I was not like in this game going from mission to mission with the automatic trip. At first you think, Buah this will be a lot of fun since there are many different specialties, but the problem is that by wanting to have so many game modes at the end the only thing they got was that the driving in each of the modes is rubbish. Motocross, especially having played MXGP PRO for almost 15 hours before, that of the crew is rubbish, normal races the vehicle is not arcade it is SUPER ARCADE, to the point where a 180 degree curve without braking or anything or The car is good for you and not even a minimum skid of anything, and so with most of the modes, the ones that happened to me the most (at least for me) were the demolition derby and the one with the plane stunts. The only moderately decent races are those of the live xtreme, and now I'm not throwing shit at you, the only thing that when changing the vehicle, sometimes like the map is upside down and that animation when changing the vehicle makes me dizzy, I repeat not I'm throwing shit, the idea is very original and well thought out, except that my body is garbage. The game is based on a system to earn money and popularity quite bad in my opinion, by winning races (good to be in the top 3) they give you money, popularity and also loot that are simply improvements for your vehicle. The only positive thing that I can see about the system gaining popularity is that with each level you go up to the icon level you will unlock a new game mode. The pieces are made well because if you win pieces with a street racing car, those pieces cannot be unlocked for the other branches like freestyle etc. On the other hand, a positive thing that I see is that the season pass is not super cheeky pay 2 win, but just by playing you can buy the vehicles that come with it, except for the 2 or 3 exclusive of the season pass. Another thing that I see very good about this game is that you can use paintings created from the community. Another thing that is very bad is that you need an internet connection to play. And well, this is my review, I only recommend the game if you buy it on sale In my case I bought it at 75% discount in this Summer Sale "}

{"text" : "It's almost time to pass the customs. Let me talk about my feelings. First of all, this game is not suitable for pure love fighters. This game is full of NTR, so that I think whether the screenwriter is cerebral palsy, the Japanese have enough abnormal conclusions. The following content involves spoilers. If you want to buy, please don’t continue reading. Give the following examples. The biggest heroine licked another man's feet. The childhood sweetheart was sexually assaulted when he was a child. ? (The description is almost the same as being sexually assaulted.) The most important NTR is 1000 years. Because of the curse, the biggest heroine lived less than 20 years. She has been reincarnated for almost 50 lives. The first time she was raped by at least three people. The last time she became pregnant and died, and then her daughter was the one who kept being fucked until a thousand years later. We can calculate that there are at least a few hundred people who have been a heroine. The Japanese are really cheap. The good thing is that the ending is not the defeat of the curse of Rotten Street, everyone is happy. Instead, he chose to let the first group of people be punished as they deserved. Justice may be late but never absent. This sentence is bullshit, and late justice is not justice. The male protagonist is not the one he was 1,000 years ago, and the female protagonist is her who was 1,000 years old. Therefore, it is said that there is no such thing as 10, 100, or 1,000 years later, because the male protagonist is not He who was 1000 years ago, he is a descendant of He. Isn't this NTR? The screenwriter, be a man, are you the one pinched by NTR? ? ? Finally, the soul state of the hero, watching the heroine get married later??? Super invincible NTR? ? ? ? ? ?

{"text" : "Alien Hallway is a strategy game that follows the tug of war formula presented in popular games such as Swords and Soldiers HD. Unfortunately for Alien Hallway, the game contains bare minimum of features presented in a tug of war game. The maps are hilariously small, with no branching paths. This means that for the majority of the game, you are left sitting on your ass spamming buttons until either you or the alien opponent is defeated. There is no strategy involved in this setup, the miners cost a whopping 10 energy which can be spammed right on cool-down in conjunction with whatever space marine(s) you wish to summon. The polish is absolutely abysmal in this game. Some aliens, specifically melee ones, do not have attack animations. They do damage by simply running or walking into your soldiers. Along with low production value, the game appears to have performance and frame-rate issues when there are too many soldiers and/or aliens on screen at once. This makes Alien Hallway virtually unplayable in the endgame. I pity the fool that spent money on this game. Yes I pity myself. "}

{"text" : "Yes, the Vap of the times of the revolution looks very bad, from the point of view of atmosphere everything is done at the highest level. 10/10 at your fingertips. I wanted to return as soon as possible, just to explore every street of the romantic city in its not most beautiful period. Well, in general, the plot component itself is not downright banal (however, the disagreements of the two sides have long been shown from different angles, which is no longer new. And in general, "the world is not divided into b / w" is also so hackneyed) although everything is again rests precisely on revenge. But in addition to all the pluses, of which there are actually not so few, the main character is very charismatic, not deprived of a sense of humor, and also handsome. As in all parts "before and after", the growth of the character as a person is shown, but for some reason it looks (finally) natural for me with Arno. Nevertheless, if we return to "before and after", then, again, IMHO only in this part with the control of the evens so terrible happened that, in addition to wanting to write a review, I also wanted to add a negative one to it. Before, everything was very convenient in controlling the character: his maneuvers were clear and you could even, so to say, feel the years. In the same origins and odyssey, even though this is a completely different pancake mechanic, I didn’t have to swear at myself and the character when something went wrong (because it’s "shlonetak" solely through my fault). But in Unity, it seemed to me that Arno was really sick and could not do what Altair could, who, by the way, learned to swim in revelations. P * zdets in one word, how I burned out from this management. At the same time, the joystick did not help at all, and the game was not particularly designed for it. In short, there were no alternatives, I had to go through the whole game with DLS on the keyboard, and in reality, throughout the entire gameplay, it was a bathert. And I'm a person who has gone through all the souls on a keyboard and I'm fine. But here he is in the gaming industry. But again, maybe this is just my problem. Xs.

{"text" : "This mmo is not like the others, something like its own separate universe without a huge open world, but with a lot of small separate and colorful locations. What specifically I like about the game: 1. Classes. Each is interesting in its own way, each has its own mechanics and beautiful effects from skills. But I still don't understand why a melee archer (pathfinder)?!?!?! Like this?!?!? 2. Dungeons. There are a lot of different dungeons with complex mechanics, challenges, fights, etc. This variety really allows you not to get bored in the game. 3. A huge variety of equipment, style, horses and other things. I have never seen such a variety in any game. You can even drive a Tyrannosaurus rex, even a snail, even with a unicorn mask on your face. In general, anything. 4. Content. There are a lot of companies to complete, despite the fact that some of them need to be completed for months, I still considered this a plus, because, in principle, in the game, except for dungeons and passing companies, there is nothing to do. Well, there are no more advantages to this. Disadvantages: 1.No class balance. From the word at all. If you take berse and chk at the same level, with equal gear, stones, etc., it will still transfer bers. Bers in general in this game is like imba, and by the way, it will soon be kicked even more with the release of a new module, so if you choose who to start playing on, then the choice is obvious. 2. Dead pvp content - why is it dead? And because the developers are vegetables that cannot make people a class balance, but because the developers are lazy and do not want to make normal rewards for pvp players. 3. Eternal lagodrome. In addition to lags, I add here bugs, crashes, long loading. Even if you have a top Internet, it's not a fact that you won't sometimes fly out of the game into the character selection window. 4. Donate. I don’t like that some things for the collection can be obtained only through donation, and only through an expensive donate. For some stupid unnecessary equipment for the collection to pay a couple of thousand? You go. 5. Astral diamonds. This is the main currency in the game. Why minus? Because the developers are so afraid of all sorts of manipulations with money in the game that they made only 100,000 ab per day available. What is 100k ab per day for players like me? With so many, I can't even go to the dungeon with normal buffs. I have already accumulated more than 3 lemons of diamonds, and it is a mockery to transfer them every day. 6. Well, in general, the developers spat completely and completely on your opinion in the game, on your complaints, requests, they will not react in any way. The support in the game is a complete bottom that never answers. 7.Events. Every year the same, the same * awards *. For a very long time, this time they decided to add a couple of new buns to the Jubilee and that's all, rejoice. Fortunately, a new module will be released soon, so you can score on some events. As a result, I wrote more minuses, so I leave the review negative and wish the developers to become more attentive to their players, otherwise the game will die again, as all this hype with the virus and get-togethers at home will pass.

{"text" : "I do not agree with this approach. By stealing the fruits of other people’s labor and then attributing all the fruits of their labor to oneself, gaining reputation and profits through this method, and then replacing the stolen parts with their own parts through the profits obtained. This is a bad start, the beginning of the market expulsion of good coins after bad coins are disguised as good coins. In the future, more developers will learn from your "advanced experience" to bypass the accumulation of necessary art, audio and video, and model materials in the creative process-you will all succeed, but every success of yours will make the creative soil become It is more barren, and the fog that nourishes infringement and illegality becomes thicker. If other developers and friends are not willing to say anything because of their affection or because of their wings, I would say that even if there are endless navy forces rushing to my game in the future and giving me various bad reviews Speak out. You are not developing alone. You are just alone destroying the entire creative ecology. "Bright Memory" is a heavy hammer hit on the road of copyright protection and healthy development.

For example: left-below - 100, right-below - also 100. Previously, such an idea was implemented in Two Digits, but there it was done in the form of two-digit numbers and numbers, three-digit numbers were added here. Accordingly, the difficulty of the game has increased and quite significantly. There are 300 levels in total with a different range of numbers. It can and has something to do .. only this is, well, a very long duration and very much brings monotony to the game, and there are no rewards (except for achievements that are unlocked if the condition is met in the second exit (this is how everything is confusing, yes)) ... You can try to go through 3 levels a day, but this is also such an occupation .. the last levels generally cheated: If you evaluate it by itself, it will go. But in fact, it becomes boring very quickly and you want to turn it off. The game is a prime example of how you can ruin the whole game with just one change. The game is not directly nightmare from this, but the mixed reviews of the game are fully justified. It was worthwhile to cut the game 3-4 times, perhaps it would brighten up the game a little.

{"text" : "Oh boy am I sad that I am changing my review... I picked up the game immediately when it got out of Early Access primarly because when I tried it before It got released , the optimisation was horrible. I was hesitant if I should pick it up but I did at last. But I was very suprised that when I started to play there was no lag. The game had been optimised and it looked even more beatufull than before.I was shocked. The devs actually did improve it a lot since Early Access. I started playing every day with my mates. We had soo much fun. Tho that wasn’t for long... After a couple of uldates rolled by I started noticing huge lag spikes, FPS drops and what not. It wasn’t very playable. Then the problem with cheaters came by and other stuff. The devs kept promising that they will fix the issues with the next patch and so on and so on. But that fix never came. Instead what did they do? Add more paid crates,cosmetics,weapon skins and uselles ♥♥♥♥. But why not? I mean I’m sure that this will fix the game.

Because they saw now that Fortnite is better and PUBG is falling behind.Or they just can’t handle the competition? Whatever the case is this is the most stupid thing they ‘ve done.

{"text" : "Mojóninteractivo.exe This work is very misleading, at the beginning pieces "wow what graphics, what shots and what powers", but sooner or later you will notice that the game is very oppressive. But ... context, Control is a 3rd person shooter, but with the addition of the paranormal abilities of the protagonist, which are mechanically reduced to throwing objects from the environment, a dodge, a shield made of floor, and the ability to float that can be used together with the previous ones, all (except floating) feed on an energy bar that is spent and recharges by stopping executing these abilities. Now, having these skills looks great, but they cannot be complemented with the environment so that they are satisfactory, are you going to dodge? It will be that no, there is a mountain of rubble, a wall, column or piece of furniture that prevents you, are you flying? Be careful with the ceiling because it is not uniform either, and the camera will not let you see well. Telekinesis and shield do work better, but the game constantly reminds you that "a moving target is a target that lives longer", which the game ignores that I am locked in corridors or surrounded by debris and columns, so it better go with a shield and throw things at enemies from a safe area. It's like you can fly, but only if you're alone in your room, if you go out you can't, that's how silly it is. Another shit, the missions, in itself, we start with an oppressive and confusing environment, even with a map it is common to lose or not find the last piece of intergalactic moss to complete the mission. What ends up finishing my patience is the approach to the secondary missions, they arise from one moment to the next and you have to accept them manually, that is, not only do they remind you that you are doing secondary missions, but you almost have to ask for them, not only that Sometimes these missions have a time limit, and moving around this building is confusing, sometimes I can't even get to the place of said mission. But the worst ones are the ones that make you return, in fact, it happened to me that I was advancing in the story and I reached a very important moment for the plot, when suddenly ... secondary mission, and unfortunately I accepted it, now the "most important" story will have to follow later. The checkpoints are souls-type bonfires, and if you don't make it, repeat the whole journey to the boss of the sponge with dark red bullets, which is among mountains of rubble, in a dimly lit area and with his friends who throw grenades you dodge, but something prevents you, it is the scenario, you died and repeat, unless you do not remember how you got there in the first place, in that case to waste time. And the funny thing is that I still don't talk about dubbing into Spanish ... it's bad, very bad, and no, I don't come like the typical Latin to throw shit at the Castilian dubbing, because well, halo 2 Latin exists, but yes, it's terrible, it's incredible that such an important game, (for being one of the first to use Ray Tracing), comes with such a poorly done dubbing, just don't worry you can play in other languages ​​such as French, where lip sync was skipped, even of the puppets (a video of the game where puppets appear) And of the dlc's… no fucking idea, who knows where they are, or if they are secondary, I'm still going to finish the game, I think it should not be long given the peak of Difficulty in which I am, but the series on the YouTube channel stays there, I was recording the campaign but I am now stopping, it is not worth recording more than 45 minutes to spend a boss. And I know what you are thinking: "tremendous one-armed" - yes ... yes, that's right, I'm not a pro player, I'm a human being with rights.

So I do not recommend this bouze at all as long as it is not fixed for good otherwise hello good rage and the disgust of being kicked by the server haphazardly. Without counting that you have to press 10 times to open a door and the same thing to pick up equipment DU to the lag, the rollbacks when you are in the vehicle, the hitboxes which are badly done, as much as you shoot in the breeze the person does not take any damage on the other hand when it is you there you take the damage ... due to the lag once again !! So if you are in Central Europe AVOID this game, wait for a good 20GB update for it to be playable and above all it is not worth 30 euros, maybe 15 euros when it is stable, but it is viola "}

{"text" : "In general, I was not going to write anything about the Whispering Willows, in my eyes the game simply did not hold up to pay attention to it with a review, it went smoothly and did not stand out in any way. It would not have existed, if not one "but" - I saw a lot of positive reviews, and finally contributed to the crawled letsplay / reviews in the YouTube tape, where the game is called "Masterpiece". - And what is so masterpiece in it? - you may ask (but I know that you don't give a fuck, just like me, hehe, high five, bro). In short, let's figure it out. Immediately, just looking at the game, I can immediately name as many as four reasons why it is interesting to me: 1). I love everything that is chilling and mysterious. 2). In games (especially from the third person), I will give preference to playing for JePe, because looking at women's buns is much more pleasant for me than at another dull peasant. In this case, the heroine is only 13 years old, but the rolls are also not visible in 2D, in fact the character is female, I don't know. 3). I love visually beautiful and stylish games, but I don't care about the graphics. And there is actually a huge difference, in these terms. 4) The game is marked "". Well, everything is clear. After the introductory video (which for some reason is in 640x480 resolution, hello, what age is it?), The game starts and we are greeted by many locations at once. Whether such nonlinearity is good or not in 2D games - I don't know and I can't judge, but personally I don't like it, you can easily get confused and be confused by changing backgrounds and locations. I still care for greater linearity, otherwise it will turn out to be another one that boasts a huge number of locations, but in fact there the devil will break his leg, trying to figure it out. Then I realized that the game is very boring, which by the way is greatly facilitated by the slow walking of the main character. 4 times I launched it, played for 10 minutes and closed it because it was unrealistically boring. You collect notes, read notes, wander and wander around the locations, looking for something ... Oh yes, by the way, you can forget about it at all - nothing terrible happens at all, there is no feeling of tension, a sense of danger, as it usually happens. In general, it is quite difficult to make a horror from 2D, in my opinion, due to the specifics of the camera (side view) and a large view for the player, but you can make the game extremely uncomfortable. : a) b) c) (yes, yes) The ghosts in the game are so cute that with similar success you can safely call the film / cartoon "Casper" "Horror". By the way, here's another thing, playing in, I learned that ghosts are far from being so ubiquitous and walking through walls can not always and not everywhere. Here, ghosts are generally represented by some kind of vegetables, for example:. The question for connoisseurs is that the ghost is nailed to the floor with nails, for all the years of living there he could not fly into the next room, look for his item? Really?! I understand that otherwise there would be no sense in the game, but it looks very stupid. with the exit of the heroine's soul to the Astral to solve problems / open doors. Well, for example in, there is generally a fox running around and changing the seasons, how do you like that, Ilon Ma ... oh, okay. In general, and what? What's so wonderful and unusual? At first I thought that my game was broken, because the Q and E buttons refused to work. It turns out that every time you re-enter the game, you need to change the layout, that's really innovation. Here we can say that this is the studio's debut game, that this is a niggle, but you know what I will tell you about the masterpieces? made by just two people and made by one person are real masterpieces. Both games are debut games, and both do not suffer from any problems, and I consider both. In the same one soundtrack is worth it, in Wispering Willows some kind of incomprehensible presenter sounds with a creak. The difference is obvious, both in general and in details. Honestly, if there were no "Horror" in the notes, but "A game for children under 3 years old" were written, there would be no bazaar at all. Okay, it would be boring, it's subjective, but there is absolutely nothing in the game to distinguish it. The ending is just a kindergarten, pants with straps. I ended the game relieved, that's all. Fortunately, this "masterpiece" for the first playthrough can be completed in 2 hours, unlike "mere mortals" who are 8-10 hours of gameplay. The game is not the worst, in general, the rules, I agree, but clearly overrated,. So it goes. Thanks for attention. "}

{"text" : "Oh, Fahrenheit. It pains me to give a negative review. I completed this game on the Xbox back in 2005 and I remember really enjoying it. But now that I've finally played it again, I don't know how I tolerated it. Maybe this is just a bad port? I hadn't even got an hour into it. So, the morning after the main character returned to his apartment, he awakens to find that what happened the previous night wasn't just a nightmare—his arms and bed sheets were bloodied. There's a lot to interact with in his apartment, so there I was inspecting objects and looking around. But because I didn't know exactly where to go and exactly what to interact with, when a cop started knocking unexpectedly and the game auto-saved this led to frustration. You're given a small amount of time to clean up the apartment before letting the cop in. (He breaks in if you're not fast enough.) The problem is, my character's still in his underpants, has slashed wrists and there's still evidence lying around. Not a thing I can do because it's auto-saved. I entered some kind of bizarro Groundhog Day-esque time loop scenario. After a few restarts I'd found all the evidence. When I figured out the correct sequence (including annoyances like picking up keys) I clearly had to execute a speedrun to make it in time. Get the bloody cloth, run to the bathroom, cram it in the washing machine, wash hands, open medical cabinet, apply bandages, close cabinet, dash to the door with the worst random tank/free walking mashup controls in the world, dash to the bedroom, hide the bloodstains, open the wardrobe, put on clothes, go to the living room, pick up the keys, and finally let the cop in. I must have tried at least fifteen times and gave up after nearly popping a vein. Am I simply bad at the game? I dunno, these mechanics suck ass but I won't rule that out. I did complete it when I was much younger and don't recall using an easy mode. Like I expressed at the start, this is all a shame because I do remember the game being fun. If there's one thing Fahrenheit gets absolutely right it's the mental health metre it features. If you buy and play this game you'll go from neutral, to tense, to anxious, to stressed, to depressed, to overwrought, and to wrecked with a risk of wrecking your controller. "}

The theme, this time touched upon, fits perfectly into the style of the game and so tightly intertwined with it that without it it is already difficult to perceive the already eclectic and burlesque world of "Killing Floor" ... The characters for the first (yes, followed) set were chosen well. Take (the closest relative) - a stylish pyromaniac and anyone's dream! An excellent outfit complements the competent display of the forearms and mitts from the first person (however, judging by this, this is already becoming the rule). Too extravagant and anonymous? No question - at your service (or), ready to parachute into the midst of a bloody battle. And take a look at! After such a breathtaking look, it’s hard to believe that these people once created a model that, in the first person view, lowered nonexistent sleeves and changed sterile medical gloves for black leather gloves! and got a brother from: a street knight sealed in homemade armor. If not the most original, then certainly the funniest model in. And, it seems, here it is - happiness: great characters, dashing biographies, tons of fun in multiplayer and ... and ...

{"text" : "It seems to me that the developers did not quite understand why people did not like the first part very much, excluding the negative due to high expectations. The first part had a very boring gameplay, but the game still had some kind of soul, the same applies to Aiden Pearce - he seemed nothing, but he was still someone. The second part is a sweet to disgusting cotton wool with exactly the same boring gameplay and super-dull hacking of chain networks. The main innovation is the "rainbow" setting. In other aspects, the game certainly improved, but I did not notice any significant difference. The attempts of the first part to make a dramatic story in a kind of noir style turned in the second part into an extravaganza of blunt-nosed jokes about "a fork in the eye and then ... time." The concentration of the mother's troll jokes is so high that I could taste the feces in my mouth and the wildest krinzh. Maybe a couple of jokes were good, but when for 1 good joke there are 9 terrible ones, it does not save the situation. I throw a separate piece of feces into Russian localizers, who simply mispronounced some of the "meme" words. But this is so, by the way. For 37 hours I didn't really understand exactly how the AI ​​brain works, so on tasks that were initially conceived as difficult, it was sometimes very easy to run through stealth, and on the contrary, seemingly easy tasks sometimes it was simply impossible to go through without rushing. Tasks are just the capture of towers in your favorite yubik style. There is some object, usually it was a computer that you need to hack, it is in a closed room, and to get there, you need to neutralize a couple of guards, hack a couple of terminals, open several doors and get to this computer - this is about 95% of all the assignments that I have passed. By the middle of the game, it was so sick of it that I successfully scored on stealth and until the finals I just kneaded everyone with a machine gun. Stealth is terribly monotonous. Shooting also leaves a lot to be desired, especially shooting at medium / long range. It is surprising that the creators of the cage cannot do top shooting in their other projects. I did not observe random events in the game, which is also very sad. Naturally, the yubiks still haven't learned how to do the normal physics of cars, so driving in this game is also incredibly disgusting, and from the first person it is generally a kind of defilement, looking at the screen was just vomiting. And cars are the only means of transportation around the city, unfortunately, there are simply no flying machines in the game. There is nothing corny to say about the plot. A group of underground scourges are fighting with hacking methods against a multi-billion dollar company, which is an immediate pure evil, wanting to know everything about everyone. With gg it is the same: there is nothing to say, if his name had not been repeated a hundred times per game, then after deleting the game I would immediately forget him. I can express my praise for the network mode. As in part 1, I really liked it, only in the second it was significantly improved. You sit and choose clothes, and then suddenly you are hacked and you have to look for a hacker using the acquired skills in the game, but it was even more interesting for me to hack people myself. I think this is the most interesting thing that I have met for passing. It's a shame that this is purely PvP related. "}

Constant bugs when it comes to adding custom characters/workshop characters into the game or using basic built in modules like props on default characters happen consistently enough that you'd think it was intentional.

I've tried to use 7 cameras (which you shouldn't have to do) to find something to work.

{"text" : "And so, having played this game for not a small amount of time, I can write a constructive review with full measure, if it were necessary to describe this game in three words, then I would say this: naivety, repetition, uniformity. Namely, the naivety of the game lies in the fact that all the characters in this game will be introduced to simple tricks like "look from behind, and then run away" and the main Persian is like "Where is he, I don't see him" (although seconds have passed 5) sometimes I caught such a facepalm from local actions that I can't describe it with a single word, the dialogues are monotonous and often not particularly interesting, and are stupidly naive! As for repetition, this is basically the fact that the game very, very rarely spoils us with new locations, most of the time you will spend in the same locations, with the difference that mobs have spawned there again, and different tasks (and even then not always) after 3 o'clock already bored, and I want to quit the game. And about the uniformity, this can probably be attributed to the second point, but I will add that basically the whole storyline will take place in familiar and boring locations. Is it fun to play and is it fun to walk where you've been 300 times? Definitely NO! This I am still silent about the respawning mobs right in front of our eyes, it seemed that you cleared the room, and a minute later a horde of zombies appeared out of nowhere, and this in every mission, it wildly enrages, as for the balance, I will say this: what to kill of one of the weakest zombies, I need to make him 5 shots in the head, from a pumped rifle !!! .... That's all, well, a few words about the economy: grind, grind, grind, grind and hundreds of thousands more grind. In order to buy something worthwhile, you need to put a lot of energy into it, you don't get money from missions, something useful is rarely dropped from mobs. Well, think for yourself, play this for you, or is it worth wasting your time after everything I wrote above, or is it better to go to something really useful. My verdict: Prohodnyak-4 out of 10.

{"text" : "A bit about Red Dead Online. The plot is a masterpiece, no doubt, but the RDO ... What's at the start, that after the release of the PC, this is a dull raw ug. Let's start with the fact that the "storyline" of Red Dead Online is as dull as possible, and was done only so that you played 2 hours in this henna and could not get the money back for it. After all, after completing you are thrown into a completely empty open world, and here the practice "Entertain yourself" works - either pay 15 gold (which is quite difficult to accumulate at the beginning of the game) to open some role for earning, or hunt 24/7 to get for food, cartridges, cards and tonics. By the way, tonics act like Bull Shark Testosterone in GTA Online, but here it has reached a new level: no PVP or PVE shootout is complete without tonics. Yes, you can buy them, for an overpriced, or of course go wandering around the huge map on a decrepit nag in search of the ingredients you need. And nowhere on the map will the location of these very ingredients be displayed, you always have to climb in the left-hand public and discord servers to find out their location. Roles are what rock has done during the year of RDO's existence, or rather added one more to the existing three roles. Personally, I bought a collector and I have no idea how to search for the same tarot cards without a custom map of the game with the location of all collections. Maybe there is some kind of entertainment in between the endless money farming? Partly yes, most of these are PVP events in an open session or full-fledged PVP matches, in which the maximum imbalance and the lack of a clear matchmaking system, that is, a beginner with lvl 10 and a revolver in his pocket can throw against a pumped-up skill with a tonic in his teeth and an ABSOLUTELY unbalanced rifle Carcano in hand. And you will have to play this pvp, because for example, there are no missions other than plot tasks: either farm in an open session, or fight against a 100-level nerd. I absolutely do not recommend buying RDR2 for the sake of the online mode, because it is stupid to drop money. "}

{"text" : "Updated: 10/25/2020 - [see below} Patch 1.02 - ridiculous! Version 1.00 - crashes as it should. 2 minutes, 5 minutes, times 10 minutes - play value: 0 Version 1.01 - crashes as it is in the mood. 2 minutes, 5 minutes, times 10 minutes - Play value: 0 Version 1.02 - Unplayable! 100GB on the system drive is apparently not enough - savegame error - constant popup! Or the game has no access to the save order - how ridiculous is it, please? I don't want to do the doctoring on my Game.exe with a hex editor - I don't really want to spend hours looking for solutions to the crashes either - change drivers, try it out. After that the game is constantly "optimized" again (WTF ?!) 40h playtime - on Ar *** 20h of which is loading time! After crashes! And time so that it is "optimized" after a driver change, patch or tralala. And time for troubleshooting - testing the settings, whether it works better with others, if necessary - and spending time in the forum, whether there are new findings and whether someone has found a solution. I am so disappointed with this piece of work that it cannot be put into words. I'm really happy for everyone who can play it without any problems. It may be great - if it works. But I can't really judge. Since the time that I spent in the game was largely characterized by looking for "campfires", i.e. saving points, so that not too much of the game progress is lost if it smears again! And now? Now I can't play it anymore. Thanks to patch 1.02. I have such a deep thumbs down like never before in a game. Alone for the fact that you try to fix a fix on a weekly basis instead of setting all levers in motion. That shows me quite clearly what I am worth as a customer. And I also express the same appreciation here. This whole cobbled-together gel pump is no good - Basta! I've finished. P.S .: I have installed 213 games, 212 of which run without any problems. Which guessing game I'm offering here can you imagine, huh? [Edit] - Typo Edit: 10/25/2020 I skipped patch 1.04 as well as 1.03 - my anger wasn't gone yet. Then I gave Patch 1.05 a chance, partly because of the many positive reports I read. For me, the game became playable at 1.05. Here and there, occasionally, there is another crash. In the meantime, it has become so isolated that it can almost be seen as negligible in view of the initial frequency. I couldn't even give an approximate time, they have become so rare. However, not everything is in order yet. The attempt of the driver update is always crowned with a crash at ~ 33% in the "optimization". Regardless of whether it was uninstalled cleanly or not. 456.71, 456.55, 456.38 just don't want to. Since the respective first start takes a lot of time, I have given the attempts in the meantime. Then I'm back to 451.67 - and lo and behold, everything is running a bit opaque (again). Since I have now enjoyed the game - and it was and actually is - I can only say about the game itself: Yeah! That is fun! Great story, great gameplay ... It's a round thing! My rating remains, whether to the understanding or incomprehension of some, on "thumbs down". The whole dilemma that arose has nothing to do with "starting difficulties" for me. That was just sloppiness! You, me - no matter who - if we worked like this, then we would have been paid for the longest time. Not?! "Sometimes" - "Occasionally" - "not working under certain conditions" - all understandable. With an infinite number of configuration options for the PC anyway. But here at least 50% of the users were affected by what they read. Sometimes more sometimes less. And I will not reward that with a "thumbs up" afterwards - and thus legitimize it afterwards. Nope! As I said: The game itself is (now) a stunner! In a great mood! "}

{"text" : "Being honest, this small crossover game is pretty fun for what it is: a cleanup simulator for a gigantic mess of a battle left behind. I could play this for a good while, if not for its shortcomings. Being that it IS a VCD game, the real drawback is one simple thing: Random chance. Trying to get a container for junk/body parts? Random chance you'll instead get more chunks to clean. Trying to get a fresh mop bucket? Random chance of more chunks. It really doesn't help a game that toes the line of tedium and cleaning satisfaction to randomly chuck more tedium at you and expect you to smile about it. It's akin to cleaning a floor only to have someone look at you, roll a die and say "well, I rolled a 10, so I guess I HAVE to step all over it, and you aren't done cleaning until it's spotless."  So for those who(for some reason) DON'T mind that end of things, it's still a pretty neat game and for the time I spent before getting 3-4 rounds of chunks, I had a pretty okay time. Not recommended if you're looking for high-action or a guaranteed fair cleaning experience, but recommended for anyone who's just looking for something to while away a couple hours. "}

With every update it got worse, no chance to play on a server at the moment, because the curious bugs appear and definitely make the game unplayable. But the greatest cheek is Keen himself, if you say something negative (with decency), you will be attacked or even banned! You always have to let yourself be put off, it's still alpha, I realize, but after 2.5 years I simply expect more than just steadily increasing PC requirements and an infinite number of bugs that are NOT fixed, although there are already x in the patch notes once it said (piston fix 4x and still does not work)! If Keen were honest, they'd confess that they lost track of it a long time! On the contrary, you are very convinced of yourself and your collection of data scrap! I very much doubt the game will ever be playable! It's a shame because the idea would get a big 20 out of 10 points, but for the implementation not even 1 out of 10. June 5, 2016 Edit: Since I've read that something has now been done on the server, I gave the game another one Given a chance and made a server. I'm really amazed at how well it works, but I don't mean to say that there are no more bugs, just that it is now reasonably playable. But I haven't built anything big with engines and pistons yet, so here's a conclusion. But I won't put the review on positive because there are still far too many bugs, alpha or not!

Now comes the fun part, the ranked matches are fine, but please add a REPORT SYSTEM.  It is crucial that the game has such features so it will prevent players from LEAVING the match halfway like an idiot.  AND NOW THE FINALE, please PLEASE remove the Capture The Flag MODE.

Like, you can play MP with what we got here but you will only get the same 5 washes out characters because they are in "META" while the new ones just aren't here at all. The Towers experience is centered on farming with an AI or just spend all your money to finish one tower because that thing ain't balanced. When I say unbalanced, is 1V5 from round 1.

{"text" : ""Preventive strike" is a vertical progression shoot em up, and it's a clone of "Air strike 3d". Finally a clone? Yes, but only when you watch it, because when you play it, it's another matter, on the screen it's a mess and it's very difficult to establish a viable tactic, once it passes, and two times it breaks. For the lifespan, only four levels, it is short for levels which are themselves very short. Very short. "Preventive strike" is like the cannada dry, it looks like "Air strike", it is golden like "Air strike", but it is not "Air strike". Yes except that it is in the wrong direction of the therm. So I know what you are going to tell me, it costs only 1 € 59 c is not expensive, but just throwing 1 € 59 out the window that is also not expensive, and at least with this solution you will not waste time, and you risk even making one happy. And yes imagine that if these 1 € 59 falls into the sleeve of the tramp downstairs with his sign "I'm hungry", and with this little nest egg he can go and buy his liter of r ouge "Eco +", and suddenly he will be happy the guy. "Preventive strike" is a dish of boiled rice if we compare it to the whole saga of 1941,194 ... which is a roast chicken lying on his bed potatoes and grilled onions, the "Raiden" saga, a paella from paella, "Sky force reloaded" from the maffe, "Sky force anniversary" tomatoes stuffed with kêfta, and so on and the best So the boiled rice is good, but only when you have nothing else to eat, and there seen all the good games that are on sale on the market; Why go private? Now if however you do not want to buy a video game, and although that's no problem, in this case support the movement of yellow vests so that they return this pseudo 5th 100% corrupt republic of Freemasons, in order to establish a true democracy, and not this bunch of canards that we have been served at all dishes for 46 years, or otherwise you can support an editor so that the "Best of Leon Zitrone's best sports commentary" finally comes out. No serious, the developer of "Preventive strike" has proven that he knows how to develop a game, and in this case, he modifies the gameplay, (because as it is it's a real nightmare), he adds levels , and in the end he calls his game "Preventive strike reloaded", from there, he will play in the big leagues and he can even increase the selling price of the game. So yes I know it's easier to say than 'to do, but I do not pretend to develop es games, I am just a consumer who notices a state of affairs, and who just like "the lighthouse of Alexandria which always sings the same melody" and which also incidentally prevents ships from running aground on the reefs, me by my wise advice I avoid the player lost and blinded by the low price to buy a super big dobe. I am honestly still surprised that there are so many positive opinions on this dobe. It is without regrets, never ever that I strongly advise against this eco + clone of "Air strike 3d". This is my opinion and it is worth what it is worth, but it is my opinion and it is done in 100% sincere mode, so now it's up to you to see with the elements of reflections you have. atchao bon dimanche.Be seeing you.

It's just that in the main menu you are greeted by white low-poly models. Soon they are "overgrown" with textures, but this is still a trifle ... With bugs, I think, everything is clear to everyone. The main one is "gameplay". 80% of TOTAL time will be spent running on the map (because of which, you get thirsty very quickly). Important! I wrote "TOTAL" (the load time counts as well). I can say that I was lucky, and at the very beginning I met a companion, of which there are very few. And he is my "journey", as a result, the next day I went in, and almost 20 minutes later "died" due to dehydration. I also strongly advise against playing on the official servers, they are EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to loot. Everything about loot is quite problematic here. In fact, there is none, but there is a lot of it. I will try to explain ... In the game itself, the variety of objects is simply surprising, but due to my inexperience, from the most interesting I found only the Mechanics of stuff generation, I also did not like it.

Despite the flaw in this game, it should be understood that this is just a teaser. I hope the developers will fix many jambs of the game, make good optimization, combat, more thoughtful dialogues, graphics, and understand that Gothic is luring the player by the fact that it is an open world, if you want to jump into the water, jump, if you want to kill a quest NPC, kill, if you want to steal, steal, or you can run around the world and die 100,500 times from some kind of tough monsters !.

{"text" : "My gripe with Borderlands 3 is the loot system. I will indicate that I have not encountered problems with the network game, as described in other reviews, although I also played with friends. I don't like the loot system as much as possible, which implies that if you want to knock out the weapon of any boss, you MUST go to this boss until you get it. Let me remind you that this is not the multiplayer Destiny or Warframe, which are essentially free MMO projects, but, damn it, a STORY SOLO / COOP GAME. Story-based AAA, which is sold for full price and at the same time has the conscience to force you to mercilessly, sadly grind stupid mobs. This is not an RPG, in which there are quests with branches, different outcomes and different rewards during the mission, here you either drop your loot or not. The drop rate can be increased on the last difficulty, BUT IT'S POSSIBLE ONLY IN NG + AFTER FULLY BEATING THE GAME AT LOW OR MEDIUM DIFFICULTY LEVEL. And all this I am talking about loot, which is unique in the game and will not drop you anywhere else, you know, right? The only way out is to jerk off poor bosses until the end of time, if you're unlucky. Why does the developer and the game itself decide for me? Why can't I knock out the boss's cannon in a full-price game, having received my well-deserved in-game content? I have no complaints about other looter shooters, because they are either free or I am not personally interested in them, but here .. Here they tell me: "Go and kill the boss as many times as you need, and it can be 5 or 10 time, or you can not kill, but then you will not receive a reward "- these are the most real 2 chairs with chiseled peaks and you know what, which do not imply a positive outcome. Is this feces offered to me and called grind, and then they also justify? Is this a free Korean mmo or what is it ?! To be fair, I will say that the shooting, graphics, appearance of locations and bosses are bearable for me and the gameplay itself was quite interesting, although it did not bring a huge variety. But I should also note that the game does not work well technically, because it crashed regularly and I noticed that with a stable high FPS, it manages to freeze even in a shelter. How? The plot is as mediocre as possible, the heroes are boring, the filling of tasks leaves much to be desired, there are very few locations, the game can be called a long-term construction with a stretch, because they have been developing for 5 years, but in the game there are no more than 5 most flawed corridor locations with minimal interaction or its complete absence. Still in the game, for some reason, they absolutely killed a heavy weapon - nowadays any Zadrischen pistol is less effective, however, this is, perhaps, my nagging. If it were not for the experience of playing with friends (and with friends, any game can be turned into a proper one), then I would be disappointed by the word at all and would not recommend buying this game to absolutely anyone. It is pointless. If you want a looter shooter, there are plenty of free and much better products on the market. Take care of yourself and your wallet. Goodbye. "}

The War option in the game looked like fun when i started out playing in, but i soon realised that was not the case, the factions are very unbalanced at the moment and its basically doom for anyone who plays the allied faction and instawin for the germans. over all i would not recommend the game even if you are a hardcore fps masterrace gamer, because you will get tired of reparing the weapons you finally could afford before you actually "git gud" and get a decent soldier in the game Dont pick this game up with the mindset that it is for free, because it's not, you will feel the need to spend money to avoid the loooooooong grinding seasons before you can buy anything, and this is money the devs dont deserve after all their moneygrab attemps.

Heat oven to 200 degrees F. Heat the safflower oil in a 5-quart Dutch oven over high heat until it reaches 320 degrees. Using a V-slicer with a wide blade, slice the potatoes with the skin on. Place in a large bowl with cold water. In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, cayenne pepper, and Old Bay seasoning. Whisk in the beer until the batter is completely smooth and free of any lumps. Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Note: The batter can be made up to 1 hour ahead of time. Drain potatoes thoroughly, removing any excess water. When oil reaches 320 degrees, submerge the potatoes in the oil. Working in small batches, fry for 2 to 3 minutes until they are pale and floppy. Remove from oil, drain, and cool to room temperature. Increase the temperature of the oil to 375 degrees. Re-immerse fries and cook until crisp and golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and drain on roasting rack. Season with kosher salt while hot and hold in the oven. Allow oil to return to 350 degrees. Lightly dredge fish strips in cornstarch. Working in small batches, dip the fish into batter and immerse into hot oil. When the batter is set, turn the pieces of fish over and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drain the fish on the roasting rack. Serve with malt vinegar. "}

{"text" : "The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a huge dissapointment after playing through it's predecessor The Amazing Spiderman. I was expecting a lot from this game(normally i wouldn't from such games) after playing through TASM, and even the gameplay vids were cool looking but were only a few sweet sides of the game. The story takes place parallely to the film(TASM 2),which makes it confusing for the people who have seen the film as a lot of things do not match.The story is one of the most weakest feature of this game,a below mediocre story. The graphics r just as awful(TASM had better graphics than this). The gameplay is another major flaw of this game.The combat in TASM was so fluidic but even  though it has the same moves(SAME MOVES,NO NEW ONES) and all it does not feel all that cool now.The web swinging mechanism which was one of my favourite features of the game has been ruined by adding some new stupid mechs which the stupid developers thought would be cool.The same side missions from the 1st game have been copy pasted here and r as boring as they had been in the previous one(they even ruined the photo shoot missions).Many of the boses r tough(THANK GOD!). The game is full of bugs and glitches and for some reason i was not able to play this game online. The comic pages r here(YAY!!) but collecting them is hectic thanx to the new web mechs(NOO!!). There a cool cameo by Stan Lee who owns a comic and arcade game store(probably the best feature of this game). Overall: 5/10( maybe 6/10 if u didn't play TASM) A game tangled on cob webs spun by bugged spiders PS: Grab it on a sale if u did not play TASM,but even if u skip it's no loss to u.

{"text" : ""Luck is a myth" - Sh. P. Cormack So the developers did not believe in rare luck, that they would get a decent game and let everything go by chance. Briefly: This is a reworked 3 part on platform 4 with a terrifying storyline. More: There are few missions, but they are well-set, interesting to play. The world is not a simple copy of the 3rd and 4th parts, but a revised one. The same forts made of 4 parts of steel, finally, look like full-fledged defensive structures, and not a pile of walls. Added all sorts of improvements, like boats for moving to the ship wherever there are collected items, so that you don't have to run back to the ship a minute, etc. The sea covered with ice, with icebergs, is beautiful. The landscapes are also good, not as monotonous as the jungle in part 4. But here's the plot ... They just took and changed the places of the Assassins and Templars in the past, spitting on all the previous games and the motivations of the order + without justifying this in any way. This is the most terrifying thing. How can you empathize with a character if you see him for 20 seconds of cutscene ?! How do they explain such low deeds of the assassins, under the leadership of Achilles ?! My answer is: nothing at all! In the same 20-30 seconds, the GG's motivation to leave the Order of the Assassins is explained. The climax of the whole game. 25 seconds of a ridiculous cut-scene and 5 seconds to make a difficult decision before betraying after it. Plot has never been a strong point of the Assassins. But he was at least tolerant. Simple, but understandable, sometimes even sound. But this part is definitely the worst of all, the plot completely spoils the impression of a quite good game for someone who misses part 4, but has no desire to replay it yet. Golden raspberry, Michaloskara, etc. for the script, this game gets unconditionally. I haven't seen that shit in a while. "}

Sadly, this game doesn't deliver what I expect from continuation of the Men of War series. It's not the setting, it's not the graphics, it's not even because there was already a Cold War mods for the original Men of War: Assault Squad 2. I'm very happy when DMS officially release a Cold War era of Men of War... but not this one. Let's talk about gameplay. It's an improved version of Men of War: Assault Squad 2 with features taken from Call to Arms. Personally I liked it, and this game stick with Direct Control Mode we know from Men of War series. The armor system has been updated with the one from Call to Arms with hitpoint system. While some don't like this, I personally prefer this one compared to RNG system from the vanilla MoWAS2. There's also helicopter, a great addition, and AI controlled airstrikes which isn't that useful. Overall most of the gameplay here is quite good and can see more improvement. There's also the new dynamic campaign generator. You get to recruit units, take them to battle and all. But, it's not as depth as I thought. Graphics... not much changed, I feel like the MGs tracer is too big while rifle tracer is almost non existent. The rest looks the same as MoWAS2 from what I see. Performance? New x64 engine means better performance, bigger maps, more units maybe... overall the engine improvement is great. So what went wrong? Well... it's content. It's Cold War... and we only got 2 factions? USA and USSR? I mean that's fine if each of these 2 factions full of content. But no... USA got like what? 5 tanks maybe... the M4A3 Sherman, M24 Chaffee, Walker Bulldog, 2 version of Patton? What about the USSR? BMP-1, PT-76. T-34, T62? Oh yes we also got like 3 helicopters? Or was it 4? And most importantly... 5 MAPS? That's all? And the dynamic campaign generator only plays on said 5 maps! What's so dynamic about that? The soundtrack... only for the menu and loading? No in-game music or winning/losing music? This game is so lacking in content, it's even worse than the early access version of Call to Arms. I really don't recommend this game at its current state.

{"text" : "Avoid this game at all costs if you feel drawn in by microtransactions. It starts off relatively innocent, then quickly asks you for more money every few minutes. Yes, it's fun game, but the excessive microtransactions, subscription, wait times escalating. It's a mobile game. The developers are clearly corrupt, every now and then an NPC will walk into your shop, to sell you something. At first it wasn't so bad, 4 dollars, 8 dollars. But now they're costing 30+  When does it end? Do they keep going up in cost? I'm bowing out here. While the gameplay is entertaining, they persist on selling it to you. I'm not against paying money for a game, but not like this. This is just preying on people.  There are keys to open chests which drop from quests but most of the time, you only get them if you're subscribed, else you have to get lucky on a boss fight that you can only do once every 8 hours. And trust me, you'll find way more chest "rewards" than you will keys. Naturally you can also open chests with the premium currency. I find the best thing to do with chests is to sell them for gold on the games market, you could sell them for gems, but 2 gems versus 450k+ gold is a pretty easy choice for me.  It's basically a rip off, of Swords and Potions, which used to be on Kongregate. That game had some microtransactions too, but nothing as bad as this, this is just an evil scummy business practice. If Microtransactions do not bother you, then by all means play. It's better than Shop heroes, and offers a great distraction. Best enjoyed with friends. But if I didn't have a friend I was helping by playing this, I'd never play it again, gladly. "}

There are literally maybe two animations in this game, looks like it was made in paint and after 3 levels you have two turn off music because it's so annoying and I would propably give it thumb up if it was worth 0.5$ because it's decent time waster game which you can finish in less than hour. Because of achievements and laziness of developer who still haven't accepted price for new (new like more than half year from implementing) currencies I can't recommend this game at all "}

You see, like any other game, this game has it's own point on what to do, or what you are suppossed to do. Well i'll start from here. First, the game is about ''Building bases'' and ''raiding'' which in my opinion is fun actually and acceptable. But when i got my hands on rust, i felt that i was just scammed by Facepunch Inc. and that the point of this game is just to die and then die again, again and again. Seriously like i don't have an hour in this game, but i feel negative about it already and i don't want to see their related to ''Rust'' products or something. Also poorly optimised, graphics are awfull (Only if you can set them, but it takes too much place) and ofcourse community. So i'll start from optimization : It's awfully optimised, just awfully. Now graphics : They are nice if you can actually settle them and make them look good, but again, it takes too much space, which will occur your game to lose FPS. And now....The community.... Community itself is very toxic and unfriendly causing me to just refund this game instantly without any positive thoughs. Players are salty, never friendly, just salty. You can barely even walk to them without getting hit by something. Yeah, that's it. I really though that this game is what i'm looking for, but it seems that it's not. It has alot of negative crap going on, even now. Facepunch can't just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ already get this game out of Alpha to atleast early access for straight 4 years, i think almost 5.

Most of the time I got stuck somewhere and the board didn't want to go forward and there wasn't any button to restart right from the same place before you got stuck which means you had to hit the restart button to restart the whole track from the beginning. Each time I exited the game it didn't exit and crashed my PC and I had to restart my computer for it to exit the game because the screen of the game froze and hang on me and task manager was useless in this case. I've at least given "The Snowboard Game" a try and better to be honest than lie about it. This wasn't something for me and maybe I'll find my snowboard fix elsewhere I hope.

{"text" : "For starters I'd like to say that I absolutely loved playing this game early 2018 and before that as well as encouraged people to play it.  BUT- Ever since they unoptimized the game it's not really enjoyable to play, or playable for that sake. The game used to run so smoothly and I never lagged once and really enjoyed playing it! But since 1.4 they have added so much U S E L E S S (I can't stress that enough) adds to their textures and particle effects that the game looks BARELY any different but having everyone who plays it Frame DROP in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spawn before entering a mission and not even jokingly, get 10 frames whenever a swarm starts or every 5 minutes of the run... Mind you I have a very good computer and so do my friends who can run high end games, and they get frame drops all the time too? I even turned down the settings to basically the lowest and turned gore off and it still drops frames so keep that also in mind before buying the game until they Fix it, at which point I will change my review. A couple other things that bother me is how expensive the DLC is for this game for no reason. I mean Winds of Magic gives you ONE new map and like a couple new character wep skins for a whopping 20 bucks (Honestly playing with the DLC items I'd price it at about 5-7 dollars, yes even with the minotaur) The other DLC's that add maps also add in 1-2 maps also so yeah.. 10$ map (If they would have released say, 5-6 maps with WINDS DLC to make a running side story it would have been worth it imo but for 1 hell naw) Also collectors edition was basically nothing for 15$  The last thing that bothered me about the game was recently when they added in a system to get "ingame currency" by doing daily and weekly missions so you could buy character outfits instead of randomly finding them in chests, which I thought was really cool. But they had us saving up and earning coin with the hopes of adding brand new hats with the ingame currency shop! Which they did add new hats soon after! They were just like $5 each tho so really a letdown to release an new currency for hats THEN say oh yeah that currency in in the toilet now with these hats 2 seconds later from making it your currency a thing.. idk THAT'S JUST MY OPINION THO they have no way to be pay to win content as they as just cosmetics so feel free to purchase them if u wanna support the dev team I guess. I honestly wanted to buy the new Kruber class to support the devs. I mean he is a REALLY cool and helpful class aswell as pretty cheap! But, until the game fixes their optimization problems and make it actually playable like it used to be I really don't want to spend $$$ to support them for only doing wrong time and time again with their recent updates. Thank you for listening to my ramble! I hope this gave you a little insight before choosing to buy the game or DLC. Feel free to correct me on anything if I'm wrong otherwise! Have a nice day. "}

{"text" : "You’ll get most of the worth out of the program if you are intending to use your own assets. + Can import your own assets + Decent selection of preloaded backgrounds  - Expensive  - No character creator - Males have fewer facial expressions  I decided to give this program a try during its free weekend run. I only gave it a short try and have no intention of committing fully to the program, but if you are a novice looking to experiment with making a VN then this program will ease you into it quite nicely. The program allows you to import your own artwork and sound if you wish to fully customize what you’re doing, but it also offers a selection of preloaded assets for you to experiment with. From my limited experiment I’ll say that the program runs fairly well and the UI is simplistic. Previewing your work is easy, and there’s nice variety in transition effects.  I only worked with what was already there and will say couple words about them. The art itself is clean and nice, both when it comes to backgrounds and characters. The soundtrack and sound effects are very limited, but what is already there is pretty decent in quality even if generic. There’s a decent sized selection of locations, the usual you are most likely familiar with from any school-related VN. Almost every location comes in variaton of day/night but there’s no weather variants, so you won’t be making any scenes that require rain, snow, or a storm for example. I for one was disappointed that there was no character creator of any sort, you are not able to even make the slightest changes like changing the hue of colors on an existing model. There are twelve characters available, among those are two adults and two children while the rest are teens. What I found annoying is that the male models have less facial expression options than the female ones. If you’re honestly interested in starting to make VNs then this program will certainly help you get started and learn the basics so you can visualize your story better. My general thoughts while running it have been neutral or favorable but in the end I leaned on giving this program a ‘Not Recommended’ and that comes down to the pricing. The base program itself is already on the hefty side, which would be acceptable if there wasn’t a ton of DLC, none of which are cheap either. While looking through the available DLC I came to the conclusion that at least half of them really should’ve been included in the base’s stock already without another paywall – specially since you won’t be able to release the VN you make regardless of how many DLCs you’ve purchased. In addition a handful of those DLC also try to police you on what type of projects you may use the content in and that truly pushed me on the negative side when it comes to the program itself.  Visual Nover Maker will work for you if you just need a program to put together the assets you have. I’d advise anyone who is looking to buy this to test it during any free weekend promotion first, preferably with your own assets in hand so you can fully see if the program lives up to your expectations.

{"text" : "Let me start this review by saying, that this is not a bad game and you should consider giving it a go, you can always refund if it does not tickle your fancy. Please keep in mind, I am not a pro at shmups, but I am good enough to usually get half the game on first run. That being said, gameplaywise Shikhondo is a generic bullet hell game with graze mechanic that charges a flash bomb. As many others I was drawn in by the visual design and music. The visual design in particular is really detailed and unique, music is ok, I bought it with soundtrack but unlike other shmups I played nothing was memorable. So now for the major problems I had: * The game looks amazing, but as a result it has also some 'loading times'. In other games loading usually is either instant or so short you do not notice. In case of Shikhondo it is really noticeable as it can take between +5 to +10 seconds (tested on lowest and highest graphical settings). * There is no death bombing - it has become sort of a standard in modern shmups, and it is really noticeable when you try to react to something you cannot dodge, it's a simple thing but would make life a lot easier. In conclusion: Shikhondo in my personal opinion is just generic, aside from visual design nothing really stands out compared to other titles which are available on steam for similar price. It is worth checking out, but if you have some experience and a library of other shmups you might be disappointed. "}

{"text" : "Not long ago, I would have given a positive assessment if I said something like "Squeeze a lemon, become a billionaire".

EDIT: And here comes the drama: Someone had fun doing some testing by changing their PC time to see how long it might take to complete the game 100%.

{"text" : "The campaign is uninteresting and boring. You're never told why you need to save this guy or kill that guy or whatever. After almost every mission, this generic soldier dude appears, says "train go boom" like he's the coolest guy ever and then vanishes. Then you are blinded by a bright light (or something like that) and you're back at the hub, preparing for another mission. You don't even have a name. Your name is literally 'player'. What!? If they wanted to give players the opportunity to create their own characters, they should have given us more options. You can only choose from a selection of faces for the protagonist (or 'your' character) and you don't even have the option to choose a black man's face. They're all white. What!? That's racist!  As if the player base wasn't low enough on pc, the 4 dlc packs as well as the season pass has divided the player base even further. There is literally NO ONE in the 'No DLC' playlists. So I guess screw me 'cause I decided get the standard edition rather than the deluxe edition. And no, I don't have anything to say about the actual multiplayer gameplay because I haven't had the pleasure to play it at all. I've searched all the (active) playlists for several minutes but I guess I have to spend another 50 bucks (or 25 on sale) to actually get to play the multiplayer. And there ain't no way in hell am I gonna do that.  Ahh, the zombies mode. I got the game for 3 reasons: 1) split screen for all modes on pc. 2) multiplayer (which doesn't even work for me). and 3) zombies. I wanted to play the zombies mode in split screen as I don't really enjoy playing it alone. But the split screen doesn't work! :D the game freezes every time I try to play zombies in split screen mode!!! YAYY :D. And now even if I manage to run it and it turns out to be great, my opinion about this game ain't never gonna change unless the multiplayer miraculously gets populated.  DON'T GET THIS GAME if you intend to get the standard edition or for the campaign. As for the zombies, I really can't say, as I wasn't fortunate enough to get it to work. "}
{"text" : "Reviewing the replays, you sit and fuck ... a person does not hit you, shooting in a completely different direction, but at the same time killing you in the head with the most creepy weapon with one or two shots. About how they sewed me through the walls in a building where there were no windows, I will not say anything at all. Blueholes are releasing updates of eight gigs, but there are no significant improvements. Now I would like to die from the fragments of a grenade detonated four or five meters from you, while you had full health and the best equipment. But when a grenade explodes right under the enemy, who is running around in his shorts and he survives at the same time, this is truly delightful. Transport bugs are a separate topic altogether. I slowly drove my motorcycle past a wooden post, the speed was exactly 10 km / h. The cradle of my bike slightly brushed against the texture and the vehicle exploded with me. Cool, isn't it? In the next skating rink, I decided not to risk it and change to a safer cart. Calmly approaching the airfield with full health, I completely stopped the car, got out of it and began to pick up things from the red box. My car in some mysterious way started to move on a flat road (without slopes) and ran over me. The funny thing is that the car was rolling 1-2 km / h, and I probably died from an allergy to the bumper ... or to the exhaust gases. In the end, the cherry on the cake was the situation where I was wearing a third level body armor and I was torn apart with one shot by hitting the body with a stinking Saiga (close, but not point blank) ... for that I was shooting in the neck without getting less than four rounds from Scar, I do not kill the enemy. Indeed ... why fix bugs and improve anti-cheat when you can just add achievements and the animals will be happy "}

{"text" : "A crash-prone, somewhat buggy mess this one is and not much else. While Hentai Mosaique Puzzle does have some nice images the majority seem distorted, with weirdly ovoid head shapes which strongly remind me of the main character from the movie ET. There is a soundtrack, but it's an irritating beat you'll probably mute sooner than later (which unfortunately mutes ALL audio, yay weird design choices). Level #2 seems to mostly cause issues for others, but in my case it was the first level. I'd unlock between 8 and 12 puzzle pieces, then the game would CTD. Upon reloading, I without exception found my progress lost. Once I started saving the game, it even ate my save upon crashing. I'd suggest playing HMP through in one sitting is probably best, as a crash at the twentieth level also partially erased my progress. For you achievement hunters, it's fairly easy to 100% this one provided it doesn't die on you...although the final two achievements take roughly an hour of babysitting the ability cooldown timers to unlock. The 10k clicks for Mana Regeneration achievement is somewhat bugged will unlock super early, probably around the 2500 clicks level. Hentai Mosaique Puzzle might be worth a look if you end up with it via the store page developer bundle like I did, or through the indie bundle their games were in. Otherwise, I'd skip it. There's no guarantee you can finish this game, and with how frequently it crashes it's more an exercise in frustration than a fun experience. "}

{"text" : "Go for half an hour and exit Mini review with spoilers (below will be given the pros and cons without disclosing the plot of the game, which by the way does not exist) Probably the main disadvantage for me was that the game is short, since it takes about half an hour to complete it, and if not collect mushrooms to get the achievement, then all 20 minutes, and then only because the character cannot run, and when you get tired of enjoying the graphics and slowly walking through the forest in search of mushrooms - you will remember my words. By the way, we are playing for a gnome and this is supposedly a magical forest, but still many things are in doubt. Let's take a three-story house, which was built on the principle that the land in the forest is expensive, and therefore you need to build up and wide, that's okay (a brilliant design solution), but the fact that you can't visit the second and third floors is nonsense ... There is also a tower with a ladder leading to the very top, and if the character had hands, perhaps the game could give us a good view, but alas and oh. And the question is brewing: "Why is all this necessary?" Further more interesting, after collecting the skulls, we must decompose them into 2 barrels and turn in the same direction as the fox is looking (God, this is the puzzle, since the voice-over will tell us how exactly they need to be decomposed), after you will turn everything the way you need a fox, which, by the way, will not get up 10 times more than us and go into the depths of the forest, but will fly away into the sky (maybe something went wrong during development, but you think that this is a feature). After the fox hides in the clouds, you can go into the cave and what is there? - Yes, nothing new, this is almost the end of the game, there will be the last puzzle, the essence of which is to stand on the plates and you do not need to remember the order in which you need to get up on them - just stand on each of them and voila: a rock, blocking your passage will slowly slide down. Then there will be a harpy (to be honest, I would have thought that this character would chase us or try to kill us somehow, but I remembered that the hero cannot run, which means it’s stupid to count on it) and you are probably wondering what will happen next? I'm afraid the answer will shock you, but not please: the harpy will die, as soon as you come up to it, the voice-over will say a few more words and the game will end. To summarize Pros: 1) the game is calm Cons: 1) the game does not live up to expectations at all (genres do not really correspond to what you see) 2) the game is too short and I don’t really want to pay for a plot for 20 minutes (since I took it for free) 3 ) maybe my own paddocks, but I would like to be able to run in this game, because you get tired of staggering through the forest, I am silent about the jump (it is not there either) 4) the main problem of the game is that it considers itself too tube, but this is not so, personally, I quickly got bored with music and this forest, where it seemed like they added a couple of objects and could be interesting to implement them, but apart from adding two buildings they did nothing more. I wanted normal riddles, I wanted more riddles, I wanted a more intelligible story or something else, the game looks more like a DEMO version, but then what to pay money for? (we will show the player our beautiful forest, he will be forgotten there and will not see a bunch of flaws) Ambiguous points: 1) achievements (they seem to be there and 3 out of 5 are not difficult to get, for the rest you will most likely have to go through the game again, since there are no guides and explanations for achievements) 2) good music, maybe it will relax someone (but after a while it began to bother me) "}

{"text" : "I'd like to start with the fact that I LOVE THIS GAME & ITS CONCEPT. But, honestly, for new players (such as myself) I can't currently recommend it. Pros: - fluid & incredible combat - many game modes - many items to unlock (& cosmetics) which require gold & levelling up, keeping you hooked. It's not as repetitive if you have something to work towards [but it's still repetitive after a while]. - no pay-to-win: all weapons AND cosmetics can be obtained by playing. Cons: -   This may not seem like such an issue, but for the people who   buy MORDHAU on launch day, it's  . On your first match, you'll be thrown in with level 50's who've unlocked every sword & weapon, and frankly, it will put you off. You don't start out with people of your own skill (level 1's), but are instead thrown in at the deep end. -   You'll read it everywhere. You'll hear it on any youtube game-reviewer's video. The imbalances in this game are so immense that, for a certain map, the winning team is already guaranteed. If that doesn't kill your motivation, then I don't know what will. Because of where the blue team - or the red team - start on certain maps, they will always have the upper hand. [A player in my recent Frontline match likened being on the opposite team to the guaranteed winners as "making a death run in garry's mod"...] This unbalanced gameplay is to be expected at launch... but not 3 months later. -   Not so much of an issue for me (check my hours), but the gameplay is very repetitive. The reasons for this are simple: 1. Minimal amount of maps (not too annoyed by this one. I'd rather they spent longer perfecting maps than doling out   broken ones) 2. The same tactics. Every. Single. Game. (Horses, javelins and firebombs are your guaranteed key to victory). One day, this game will be "fixed". Hopefully soon, if the devs can act on the wishes of the community. When the imbalances in the game are corrected (whether that's altering maps or changing OP weapons), I would   MORDHAU. "}

{"text" : "-The game was rushed out of Early Access, everyone agrees. It lacks finishes, stability for some, balancing. -The servers are empty, the new ones are quickly discouraged for lack of tutorial and annoyed to face experienced players for the most part. -No communication from Devs with us players / consumers, total silence. We just want to know their plan to sort things out and be reassured. We just feel ... betrayed and especially the veterans of the license. Wishing to share this experience with other FRs, I exceptionally wrote this review to remedy one of the game's flaws, its lack of promotion. I bought the game on 08/19/2016 and do not know the two previous games, the Savage license at 13 after all! If you like shooting games (FPS) and / or strategy games (RTS) then chances are you will like it. Team play is at the center of its gameplay, you better like cooperation. Hey ... Reminds me of Warcraft I, it's no longer Man Vs Orcs but Man Vs Beasts ... No matter ... on larger or smaller maps. (Official servers) Up to 32 vs 32 on custom servers I believe. Finally I rather judge the FPS mode, I have very little to try the Commander mode. They are enough to immerse us in the action and that's what matters. The maps lack variety, always outside, vast plains, it's green. So green that it feels like Ireland or Great Britain, what do I know? :-P :-P There are currently 4 or 5 maps. A map called Crossroad, remake from a previous Savage, will soon be released. The veterans of the license are delighted, me too! : I only tried this mode briefly in tutorial mode and it looks a lot like other RTS I have played in terms of display and gameplay. The funny thing is to order human players after all. Finally funny when the team follows the instructions, when this is not the case the Comm can "get angry". There are ingame commands that allow players to give advice to the commander. especially if he does not communicate and listen to the advice given to him. There are also voice commands as well as the integrated VOip. (Voice Chat) The other part of the gameplay, which by proportion most players will experience the most, is the FPS part! When it appears, after pressing E, a screen appears. You choose the unit you want to embody for this "short life", as well as the secondary (ranged) weapon to equip. You can also take accessories, 3 slots available. Secondary weapons, even primary ones, as well as accessories depend on the side and the chosen unit. It also takes time to understand how to use it properly, when and how to do it. Finally the mines to be placed on the ground, that's fine, we understand quite quickly! ^^ while thanks to different accessories / bonuses that they can apply to their weapon. (poison, life steal, stamina steal) Humans cannot upgrade their melee weapon for example. , which has the effect of subjecting the poor baby to a mini-stun, the time to place a blow of ax what! In my experience, I can block an attack and retaliate I still get gutted lol. Yes the Beasts have this unique ability to jump, much like the Hunter in Left 4 Dead. They are therefore very mobile. ;-) There is a sensitivity setting for the melee and another for the ranged weapon, convenient. Each camp therefore has its gameplay, it seems that the beasts are recommended for learning to play, they kill their enemies more easily overall. As promised, a crisp dialogue can be found in the comments, check it out! ;-) "}

{"text" : "6/10 not bad Although I only played for 300+ hours, I started playing the game when the game just came out in 15 years. It is a good game. I personally think it is one of the best games in the survival game. But the plug-in and the dawn company are not the game. As let players disappointed in this game time and time again, hope that survival can usher in its second spring, and also hope that Dawn can manage the advantages of this game. 1. Optimization is okay. After all, the game is 2 years old. 2. The new version is more like Survival of zombies and wild animals are no longer furnishings 3. It is highly recommended that the new version of the building system has a high degree of freedom and building skins :) Disadvantages 1. Plug-ins have always been a big problem for survival and the dawn company seems to be now Basically ignore it 2. There are many bugs and even some bugs that have existed 2 years ago and have not been fixed yet. 3. The new version now only releases part of the map. The limitations are very large. When the new version first opened, the highest peak was 5000+ and now again It fell to around 2000. Many friends lost interest in the game after pve built their home. "}

{"text" : "TL;DR : Singularity Roller is a frustrating "demo" made out of default Unreal Engine library assets, which does not worth $0.1, let alone the current steam price of $5. In the name of fairness, let's put everything it has to offer to perspective: --- Positives first (the glass half full section): --- + You control a roller ball with some sort of energy field around it, which "might" wow you for the first 10secs + The excitement of having to hunt through a maze for "something" -> initial impression + Achievements (I kid you not, 515! TSA points from this! Mind boggling) --- Neutrals to balance it out (the couldn't think of anything else section): --- = Reminds you why spring-cleaning your library off games you will always regret having is important = The need to start SteamVR for no reason at all; why not? (though if you exit SteamVR it still works) = Not saving any options, why have them at all? (added for completeness) = Hardly optimised, with a massive 5.3GB hard disk footprint for a 10-15min demo of a game   (a single resources "pak" file is found, named LandscapeMountains - perhaps there is more to it?) --- Negatives for last (no nails or coffins have been hurt in this section): --- - Take a cuboid, hollow it out, add 2 wall cross-sections in it, some steps on the side and ...    call that "the level" - Now add a very loose control to a funky roller ball, you know the "move + jump" type and ...    call that the "gameplay" - Spice it up with 50 other static balls, each for a cool steam achievement of Epic TSA proportions and ...    call that the "motivation to play" - Sprinkle it with tons of bugs (how can such a sort game have so many bugs?) and ...    call that the "challenge" - Finish it off, with the pièce de résistance (or cherry on top for some) with the last achievement still being broken    and call that the "freaking frustration" ** - Go on steam, pass the approval process and this piece of trash is then called "a game" ----- Personally, Singularity Roller infuriated me so much, it actually made me wanna go out, even though we are still under lockdown and risk cv-19, rather than having to spend another second chasing that 50th achievement (for closure). ** As a postscript, I would like to thank @In-sight- for the solution to the 50th cheevo bug, which was by hitting "K" when starting and pocketing 48/50 "non" roller balls immediately (can't get back the time I spent on it but you are all welcome to use it for sanity's sake) ----- Credit here: "}

{"text" : ""I already WORKED for the REAL MONEY, and bought this game.  WHY am I having to WORK MORE, just to PLAY..!?" Just go get into some other F2P / P2W game.  This one has a retail price, for some strange reason... I mean, it was fun when it came out the first time.  Hackers putting $2 billion bounties on people randomly...  there was nothing more exciting than seeing every dot on the map suddenly turn and start chasing the bountiful bounty...  So much money, though.  Many would eventually split the massive amount of glitched money around the other players on the map.  Hell--  Not like I even needed the $30 billion that would pile up on me.   But, that would only land many player in "virtual jail", if even just receiving said glitched money.  Even a phone call to Rockstar support wouldn't change this.  I tell ya, being treated like a pseudo-criminal is one thing, but for the very people I PAID for the experience, to treat an honest and faithful customer of many years like a REAL criminal....  Absolutely DISGUSTING. Yes, I am bitter.  May always be, at this rate.  If the game could've just merited a little more attention OFFLINE (a.k.a. where I don't have to fear the Rockstar Police), then I might feel a bit more off-base with a "Not Recommended" review.  However, this game is only getting development with the Online portion.  And that is quite literally a "Pay-to-play" structure.  Gameplay Online is severely reliant upon having the GTA$ to afford nearly every aspect of the game.  Even other players can easily cost you money without even being cheaters.  Just the typical griefing of online MP. My final thought on this game online, which is all that counts to Rockstar, is the same thought I had countless times when playing, and struggling for cash to afford even some casual playing.....

{"text" : "Once again I am upset that the game cannot be judged neutral. The game clearly falls short of "recommend", but not so bad as to be "not recommended". I thought for a very long time what to put on the review and decided to make it red, because I will criticize it, the red mark is somehow more striking than the blue one, and this will be fairer than the marks 9/10 and 10 / 10 from igrozhur. 1. The plot. It is not terrible, as it could in principle be, but it also gives you absolutely nothing in the quality of emotions, logic and meaning. The main plot is based on a very simple theme, and is a kind of road movie. And all would be fine, but the developers did not manage to give you emotions and start worrying about the main characters and their relationship. We have a bunch of examples from games when it worked: The Walking Dead, TLOU1, GoW, add what you want. And the relationship of the characters is usually touched when the developers pull the strings that are needed and do it unnoticed. Well, or noticeably, but effective. I see how they tried to show us the development of the relationship between Amicia and Hugo, but everything is so strained and naive that you just beat a cool story and that's it. Minor characters are not remembered, and their fate is guessed after you see them in a certain scene. Unexpected turns may be unexpected, but somehow you don't go crazy. Many plot things at the end of the game are either forgotten, or the developers have twisted something and did not understand what they did. Spoiler alert: There are also such stupid logical errors in the game that instantly catch your eye. Spoiler:. For some reason, an interesting relationship (between mother and Amicia) is hammered in the end. But in history, everyone sees their own, and I have no doubt that the story about the older sister and little brother can really touch someone. 2. Stealth. Nuuu ... I'm an advocate of real stealth in first person games. Although there are examples when there were worthy projects from the third, for example, Aragami or Tenchu. But in such games the player is given some kind of freedom and action field. Stealth in Freaky Tale is very mediocre and not complicated from the word at all. He works according to the rule "do it now, and not differently at another time." There are pots hanging, and you will throw a stone at them, and you have no option - neither to bypass the enemy, because everything is quite linear, nor to throw a stone in another place: he either does not exist, or he will not be distracted by this, nothing. There were a maximum of two moments in the game when there was stealth with a more or less different way of passing, but this is extremely small. But after going through the whole game, I conclude that this is not a stealth game. The game has a lot of different components: here you were running forward, an arcade boss, a joker with a sling, and "puzzles" with light. And it is somehow difficult to give an exact definition of what kind of game it is and what genre lover will like it. But definitely not for stealth. 3. The problem is freedom. The game is generally pretty ... very restrictive for the player. The final boss is the culmination of this limitation. A step to the left, a step to the right - shooting. If you haven't pulled the sling in time, you won't be given a second chance. You will not run away, you will not hide, you will not fight back, well, nothing at all. This is a game where you have to follow the terms and how the developer decided to make the game. Well, here you have to do this, stand here and do this. You are not given freedom, and it is very frustrating. A wonderful beautiful atmospheric world, and okay, be it linear, but not so much .. 4. Price. 1500r for a game of this quality is too much. This is a pure middle peasant, which can only be taken on a skid if you want to find yourself in France, which has been captured by rats. The game has no freaky (lol) graphics, I have already said about the gameplay and the plot. I understand that the game was made with a minimal budget, but let's not put up such a price tag on this occasion. I will praise the game for the good music, great atmosphere and flowers that Hugo fixes in Amicia's hair. In general, the toy is not bad, but in general there is nothing in it that will be remembered for a long time or leave some emotions. The gameplay is disappointing. 6/10 "}

Even when you do beat crazy bosses, you don't get the feeling of accomplishment of anything, it's just Yay, boss is dead. There's so far not a single boss that I've liked to fight, unlike DS3. Open world bosses can have 1 life taken down by sneak attack, so you undermine the whole premise of epic boss fight. And you have to do this, otherwise you'll be facing them with ton of ads when you die to their unblockable combo. Especially samurai bosses show how lackluster is our character. You go through the game with basic left click attacks and block, there's parry but only for thrust attacks, sometimes it doesn't register and bosses randomly switch to the same telegraphed  whirl attack, which you can't block.  Bosses have interesting, complex combos, while you literally use basic left click attacks and try to time your blocks. It's honestly a disappointing samurai game, about sad life of a low life warrior, who's seen by all as traitor and literally drains life force out of those around him when he dies. There is no redeeming qualities about this game, that would make me recommend it to people. Buy Nioh and have some actual fun or go back to Dark Souls to enjoy your time. "}

However, sometimes I bump into enemies on complete accident because of the extremely quick jetpack. Once drained, the jetpack appears to slow down. Besides the above descriptions, all I can tell you from there are various yellow orbs that you can collect around the map. I'm not sure if it's ammo or what exactly, but they are scattered about the map. From there, I'm lost. I think to advance you need to touch a burning flower or something.

{"text" : "game will do fraudulent charges on your account stealing your money double charging you for packages, if you speak to support, it's a common issue and they refuse to do anything about it. Figure I might explain more to warn other people, if buy the monthly card in game, it will setup a monthly subscription on your account in steam and at the renewal time  auto take out the money based on the card. perfect right? sure, then the 2nd day they take out another monthly payment, 3rd day, they take out another payment, you see where this is going.  Lucky I caught this before it took out anymore more by cancelling the sub in steam. The fun part is, all this is non-refundable because in game items are no refund, double charge or not, steam agree'ed they'd never refund it, game company tells you a monthly sub means you'll be charged more than once, so they don't care either plus the policy is also no refunds for in game items. The weird thing is, you get charged all this, OUT of game using steam sub. strange. nothing in game about it. Edit: after steam support 100% refused to read my messages and spending roughly 1-2 weeks going back and forth I was finally able to get a Support member on steam who could read and got my refund on the double purchase, but LIKE i been saying and LIKE what this guy said, they dont normally do refunds for DLC's but BECAUSE this company has a known issues(going back to 2016) that it will double charge your card. Also if you want a refund, you have to get proof that you spoke with warplanet first as steam pretty much tells you to pound sound with my first 8 replies from them. and they will close your ticket without reading your message so dont ever asked them to close the ticket with new info as they'll skip any new info and close the tickket, they'll use that as an excuse not to do their job. ALSO WARNING PRE-authorized amount is a lie, steam will and does over charge that amount and tells you too bad it's non-refundable. Yes thats correct, if a game charges you x4 the amount you set in the pre-authorized, steam WILL/DOES allow any game to by pass this limit. When you questioned them about this, they just give you the useless info page about how subs work, if you reply there is no info on there about steam going above the pre authorized amount, and they'll close your ticket, be safe and dont put too much money on steam as steam and these shady companies work together with policy's and TOS  to steal it and do everything not to give it back.

Combat is not that hard but rather annoying and unrewarding (I know you should mostly sneak but sometimes you can't dodge combat) - Story didn't catch my attention for that long. A bit boring per se. Characters aren't that interesting for the most part. - I kinda would have liked the idea of the open-ish game world but there were some poor level designs that made me just frustrated at times. There were some areas that took a long time to figure out the next objective. Some areas were just pain to complete. In conclusion: Although Thief is a nice looking and performance-wise stable experienc, it lacks the certain mechanics to keep me interested for longer than a few hours or so. I didn't enjoy combat, exploration nor puzzles so I decided I don't want to sink any more hours into this game. Though I didn't like this game, many people certainly do based on the positive reviews. I would like to give this game positive score since the flaws aren't massive but as I didn't enjoy playing it long enough to complete it, I have to 'Not Recommend' this.

(might just be me that hasn't got the hang of it, but annoying as hell) -I found the overall skill level strange, in one map you compete against equals and having a good fight then the next map you can get demolished or demolish them. It's often the maps you play that determine the outcome. -Can't really recommend this, before they have tweaked some of the content, and I wont come back before that either. "}

{"text" : "The game has some good points but it mostly disappointed me. You play as a 60something chief of police whose wife left him, in a city with a corrupt mayor and a coworker that practically forces you into a position where you have to work for the Mafia. Getting into the game I thought this would be a nice "Choose your own adventure" kind of thing with some management elements however in the whole game there's only 2 major choices that merely decide what ending you get. And sometimes there's quite a gap between any two story segments in the game. The vast majority of your time will be spent on the management side of things. Who to hire, who to fire, who should respond to a call, who to promote etc. Quite often your officers will ask you how to proceed in the crimes they are in the process of stopping. However that also falls down flat. You get 3 choices, one professional, one sloppy and one funny. So it's easy to tell what you need to pick every single time and has no effect on your story at all. The management part of the game can be rather fun in Sandbox mode but there's one major problem with that. In order to unlock it you have to first finish the Story, something that requires a bit over 10 hours to do. So if you wanna sandbox you're required to waste that time on a wasted playthrough with mediocre to bad story since you can't continue with that one in sandbox. The one great thing about the game is the music. There's a great selection of Jazz and Classical tunes you can get and listen to during your time as Chief of Police. "}

{"text" : "EDIT 2 : After the Iceborne update, Performance issues are back. I re-edited my review. Seems that Capcom achieved to create a "regressive Update" (yeah it's a contradiction, right?). EDIT : After the last patch, seems there are no more connection issues. So I edited my review. Big fan of Monster Hunter series, i was waiting for this PC version for a long time. Now that I have it I can say that for the most part it lived up to my expectations, they added many features that I hoped for. - Good variety of monsters to hunt: old as much as new ones (some are a dissapointment but    hey, it's my opinion). - The maps are gorgeous, and dynamic : you can use the field to your advantage. - Since the Online mode works fine, plenty of hunters to play with.   Good feature : your lobby can support up to 16 players, helps alot if you have more than 3    friends (old games were limited to 4) playing with you. - Iceborne is a good expansion, lots of new monsters to hunt (plus those yet to come) - The maps are bigger wider - The new featured tool Clutch claw is a bit too much, though it adds some flashy moves. The game at it's core is good but UNFORTUNATELY, and I think all those months of delay was alot of wait for a mere port with big performance issues:    - Alt-Tab when the game runs in the Fullscreen mode causes a crash...    - The game is even more taxing on your system than it used to be (90-99% of CPU/GPU usage, and I tried many "fixes") I recommended the game since 11Nov 2018, but as it is now I DON'T RECOMMEND buying it!

{"text" : "Even if we ignore the disagreements I have with the design philosophy and writing of Fallout 3 and its expansions (in comparison to the OG Fallout games and New Vegas), I absolutely cannot recommend this game if you are using modern hardware and operating systems. Fallout 3 didn't manage to launch before applying community-made ("unofficial") patches and fixes. Even after those fixes, loading saves takes a long time, there are random but reproducible crashes to desktop (such as an extremely annoying crash to desktop when attempting to get off the Rivet City boat; even taking an alternative route to a different exit crashed the game so my only solution was to use console commands to teleport myself to a different area), and some elements of the UI tend to freeze (like, stay in place on the screen) for no reason, and that issue even persists through loads and exiting to the main menu (imagine how unplayable the game is when you have an enemy marker stuck on your compass or when the quest marker doesn't update). Overall the game is a mess on a technical level, still playable but with very huge caveats that make it borderline unplayable for sessions that are longer than 10 minutes. "}

{"text" : "I cleared 100%, but I'm very worried about whether to recommend it or not. The degree of perfection of the pixel art is wonderful, and the details are drawn in every detail of the person, background, and accessories, and it is beautiful. In addition, it moves around finely and smoothly, so it makes me impressed. Players who see this will be captivated in an instant. Even the recommended players are unpopular in the reviews because of the degree of perfection that changes depending on how they perceive the content after the middle of the game. From the beginning to the middle, exploration, puzzle solving and action are very complete and you can be confident that it will definitely be a masterpiece. However, after the middle stage, the game itself will be stalled suddenly because there are many unadjusted and rough parts exposed. Since "grab" and "landing" are the same key (mouse), it is very easy to accidentally explode, and if you land, there will be a lag before you jump up, so you will not be able to proceed at a good tempo. The movement behavior is also a little quirky, and I feel frustrated that I can't move it well when I try to make small movements. The essential action of grabbing a companion cannot be used unless it is in flight, so it is frustrating that once you land due to an enemy attack or accidental explosion, you have to fly once and call your companion. Especially unfriendly is the event scene in the middle stage and the operability of the mini game. If you want to go on the screen, you will feel stressed because of the specification that you can not move intuitively by pressing the upper button. In addition, it has a vicious and unfriendly design with screen effects. Also, if you make a mistake in this event scene, it will be redone, so it will ruin the scene with a good deal. Screen switching is very unfriendly and hard to see. It became noticeable from the middle of the stage, which is a factor that makes it extremely difficult in mini games. In addition, since it takes a moment to switch, it may not be possible to move smoothly, and the shaking of the screen will be expressed violently after the middle stage, and there will be situations where you cannot even grasp where you are or what you are aiming for. It doesn't work as a game because there are scenes that shake considerably even during boss battles and event scenes. I will search for coins in the collection through the whole story, but since there is no map and no fast travel, I rarely search the same map many times like Metroidvania, and it has become a face-clear type game. It is very regrettable that there are many stages that are not fully utilized because the skills of friends are only used to clear the stage on the spot. I wish there were more variations in solving the mystery. The difficulty level is not so difficult, so it is very easy to clear. Knockback when damaged and down when hitting a wall with knockback are just slowing down the tempo, and there are many situations where you get hooked by losing sight of your own machine. If it goes down, the operability that you can not catch friends unless you fly once is also a problem. As for the boss battle, the attack pattern is the same, only the speed increases, and there is no puzzle element using the skills of friends, so it is not interesting. It is a very regrettable game with beautifully moving pixel art and a high degree of perfection in the early stages, and it becomes sluggish after the middle stage as if it falls down. Even so, it is reasonably organized and you can enjoy playing until it is clear, so I can recommend it ... but it is a very annoying game when you combine the high price and volume. Buy it even at the time of sale. "}

{"text" : "The game used to be really good and fun. From time to time though, even flying has just gotten worse. The tank battles were great at first, better than in WoT (if you want to compare it). But now it is hailing "one-hits" without end and "unfair" situations are increasing which can be very frustrating. Example: You yourself drive the Tiger II and a few hundred meters in front of you, an IS appears. You have the advantage that you can see the opponent earlier (due to the fact that he comes around the corner) What do you do? Aim and shoot. So far so good. The IS took a lot of damage. Now ISIS shoots, hits, and you're dead. First of all, you ask yourself: "Where did he shoot now that I was broken with one shot?" Now the incredibly cool "Killcam" follows and shows that he shot through your best armor and your ammo went up. For the most part, I can only say positive things about the planes in tank battles: I think it's great that planes and tanks take part in a battle on a map. However, if the opponents have the upper hand and your team is not baked to capture the points, the opponents like to spam heavy bombers and cut down everything that is not on the trees at 3. It is not uncommon for a bomber to spawn too close to enemy fighter pilots, who like to bring you out of the sky with a volley. (If there are Russians GG) There are a lot of such situations, but the Tier I Russians still top everything. Incredible firepower and agile like a fish in water. It is not uncommon for these pilots to have 12 kills in one round, even if you are playing against Tier II - III (seen everything yourself). All in all, it was a great game, but all the changes made it unplayable for me now and I can recommend it if you want to try it out but don't want to play long term. Was a good time, R.I.P Jack88 "}

{"text" : "A peculiar game with absurdist humour. Which in my opinion is its main redeeming quality. Gameplay: You play as a cat in the turkey castle/headquarters trying to find your way around. There's very little explaining and lacks any tutorial or even a keymap setting in order to check the keys out. Apparently it uses WASD and Q/E/R but you have to stumble on your own pressing random keys until you figure out what does what. You have your main sword attack, a ranged attack that has limited ammo and mousetraps that are even more limited. It is possible there's something else in your arsenal that I did not manage to find. Combat in itself feels VERY clunky which is something that makes the game difficult. I do enjoy difficult games but only when said difficulty is not based on clunky controls and animations but actual gameplay difficulty. The game feels very much rushed which is evident when you find a huge bug at the first minute of playing. Running to the corridor to the far right, from the first room you start in, makes you fall through the geometry and respawn at the start. This is 100% repeatable and you can't help but wonder how something this huge went by unnoticed? Other than that, gameplay, once you get the hang of it, feels very repetitive. Graphics: Graphics-wise the game is mediocre. It is made with Unity engine and I'm pretty sure I've seen some artwork assets (eg the protagonist's armor) in several other projects. There are very few graphical settings (mainly Resolution, Fullscreen, VSync and AA toggle) and only the turkeys look very good in my opinion. Music/Sound Design: While music quality is decent it is also quite repetitive and gets old fast. Very fast. Sound effects are good. Pros: -Funny. Neutral: -Some artwork assets do not look original. Cons: -Clunky combat -Very repetitive gameplay. -Repetitive music. -Very high price for what it is. Conclusion: I can not recommend this game at its current price of 14 Euro. Perhaps bundled or on sale for the comedy value alone. Score: Gameplay:		4/10 Graphics:		        5/10 Music/Sound:	        5/10 Concept/Story:	6/10 More game reviews @ "}

And this garbage cannot be abandoned in any way, there is no such button, you will run after one survivor, while the rest will rush generators, because you already know that you will not come to them. To summarize: the game is not bad, but the main problem is that the game for the survivors does not require special skill and fun, while the game for the killer is intense and requires a lot of experience.

(My specs are quite good) - Visibility at medium to long distances is inexistent due to how the game renders everything awfuly - The spawn system is downright stupid and annoying, and makes me not even want to play, every time you die you have to spend an average of almost a minute in the menus looking at the map doing nothing, and that is only if your spawn-point has not been captured in the meantime, because if it is you'll have to wait another extra 30 seconds to spawn because your spawn "wave" will have gone. - There's no kind of tutorial or anything that shows how the game should be played, i didn't even know thare was a functioning commander role until i had played a few games and there was a dude yelling through the voice coms. - The game is missing progression, there are a couple of things but nothing that would make me want to play for. For that matter the game can get very stale. - The limit in the classes you can choose is very restricted, meaning that you'll play as a simple rifleman 95% of the time, and there's almost nothing you'll unlock or progress with that rifleman. - It's missing some sort of mode more dynamic, without class limits and reduced spawn times. - Player base is quite small due to the aforementioned factors, at times it will be hard to find a suitable server, or not having to queue for a while. All in all i would not recommend the game, you're better of saving that hard earned cash instead of spending it here. "}
{"text" : "You're a part of a team of soldiers defending a (badly) fortified base and trying to find out what the hell is going on by rescuing medics and scientics that might have insight into it. Every once and a while you get a main story mission, with one or two side ones thrown in. And it works like ♥♥♥♥. Every single time you get a mission on the other side of the map, zeds decide to siege your base. By the time you get back there, they have already broken the parimiter since your squad mates are utterly incompetent. Even when you're in there, ready and willing to defend the base at all cost, they attack from multiple sides, and while you're defending one, your team is dumb enough to let them breach the other.  You can get air/drone/artillery support but since this is bugged up piece of ♥♥♥♥, it will often hit objects near the zeds (the wired fence is especially good at preventing the damage to zombies, must be made of titanium). On top of that, the map is badly designed, it's basically an elipse with 7-8 pockets of couple of streets that you need to go into to finish a mission. This leads to you driving around like a moron on the highway 90% of the game. If that's not enough, there are also disappearing enemies and NPC that can prevent a mission from being completed (and leading to a mission giver criticizing you for `not caring about civilians`). One of the new vehicles, the armoured army truck is so lightweight and touchy, it loses wheels after 3 mins of careful driving. New waepos might be interesting if they weren't absolutely useless. If you don't hit headshots you might as well be giving them a back rub so they feel more relaxed while they consume your flesh. And to finish off this rant - if you're nearing end game, zombies start spawning faster, so you're not even safe in little enclosed areas that you cleared a minute ago, 5 meters from your barricaded outpost armed with artillery.

{"text" : "Story: -What story a lot of it is cut out and put on the Anime and prequel Movie that are both kind of whatever.At random times your friends will leave and if u don't have the dlc well ♥♥♥♥ meh man i guess u get 0 character development haha.The plot is interesting but they speed it up and make it the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ experiance possible. The characters: -As i said 0 character development throughout the whole game.Its a group of 4 friends but you never get to understand who they are and why they have such a close bond in the main game.Instead you have to pay 5 euros for each characters own DLC that gives them some development but in the end its whatever since u get 0 development in the main ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.The game tries to make you feel sad at times but im sitting here just waiting for the cutscene to end because i literaly have no love for these characters i don't understand why i should be sad for them since its not EPXLAINED IN THE MAIN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME. The World: -The only thing Square Enix did well here is the world building,its truly wonderful to drive around in your car and just take it all in with some music playing in the background.As a world its pretty well made but its used to a very poor degree.We have this big open land that streches far and wide but thats exactly the problem there is just land no actual content. The Side Quests and Hunts: -Honestly i found all of the side quests fun in the first 10 hours of the game,but as u get to the end game they are just repeating pieces of trash.The hunts are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ broken it kills my soul,i mean u can finish a dungeon kill the boss of that dungeon and then u can get the same mother ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss in a hunt,go in the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dungeon and repeat the whole process over again.Great game design! The Combat: -This is the same,for the first 10 hours i was loving the combat but when u get to know it,you realize that its so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ and boring that you might as well use Ring of the Lucii to skip all of it.To do combos u just hold down LMB i am not even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ joking.To dodge you just hold RMB.If you by some miracle you die in combat you get a brief period in which u can use a potion to get u back at FULL HP so u can waste ur time in combat some more.There comes a point in the game where i didn't even bother killing the lvl 80+ monsters i just used Ring of the Lucii Shift+F combo to end it in 5 seconds and not waste my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time. The Music: -The only redeeming quality of this god forsaken game is the soundtracks,i love all of them and i find them quite enjoyable to play when ur riding ur Chocobo or when ur in the Regalia.My favorite piece has got to be the one vs Leviathan(worst boss fight known to man kind but whatever).Sadly this will never be enough to fix all of the others things mentioned above and below. The Endgame: -The endgame is honestly boring af to me,what you get a flying car wow,nice,amazing,good job now i can forgive all of the ♥♥♥♥ i had to go through to get it and the boring side quests i had to do.Leveling is so easy if u know what ur doing too,you just rack up a ton of xp from doing some side quests and main missions and you go sleep in a Hotel for 3x the xp and you just shoot up in levels like a rocket. The upgrade system: -Speaking of which the upgrade system is also trash,so many things are pointless here and actually give u nothing in terms of gameplay.I guess its passable,i did went kind of overboard saying "nothing" you do get some cool stuff here and their for combat but as i said above,if ur not even going to do the combat why even bother.. The Dungeons: -Some dungeons are fun little things to do and find right,but some of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ are the worst things you can do in Life and a total waste of ur ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time.You get to find a dungeon that is full of parkour,meanwhile the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ movement controls in FF15 are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ that u fall off 100000 times and if u do not lose ur sanity because of that,then you will because after you fall you get to do that whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ over again ha,ha,ha (im literaly dieing on the inside). Conclusion: -♥♥♥♥ this game and ♥♥♥♥ the developers,10 years of development and we get this unpolished turd.This could have been one of the best games ever made but they ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it up so hard.From large parts of the story being cut out,the main characters having 0 development in the main game to the combat being absolute garbage and a total waste of time.I really did love this game when i started playing,i though it was a masterpiece but when you play it for long enough you start seeing the cracks in the gameplay,until it finally Shatters.

An easy fix would be a confirmation to end the game too. That gate ending right as soon as you step out angered me extremely because I was returning back towards the hall too, just came around it to see if there is something on the other side.

Let me count the reasons. - First of all, Role Playing in the game is very limited, unfortunately. It may be back even from Warband. I suffered from the optimization problem, my computer is fine; I could not understand. Let me clarify the "role play is limited" issue: There is no official role play in the game, they have fixed everything. For example, deciding whether your character will be honorable or dishonorable. I forgot there was one more perk. Do you execute the prisoners or whatever they determine. The policy system is back. I can say that I enjoyed the policies in the Warband more. They have some good systems but they are missing. I could not understand the issue of having children, I could not do it. I think the marriage system was bad. The dialogues are stable, they almost never change.It is an ironic situation, for example: I went to the man, I cut off some of his family, I go near him, we speak neutrally like the head of the game. I became king, I do not understand whether I am or not. I am just saying it is not to say bad or something. A kingdom wins one or two wars, WC does. See: Since Khuzait Role Playing options are not wide, every game you can experience after buying a caravan and increasing your income is the same, almost the same. The occasional cancerous Crash and Bugs. The castles are too empty, he could have added something on the Warband in such a time. The last time I played there was so much imbalance between Kingdoms, I still don't know if it is. There was no developing relationship, I think the last time I played: D Khuzait khan, if I remember correctly I gave a prisoner gift to develop a relationship with Monchug, I gifted close to 50k money, maybe even more. You know what we can do is very limited, so are NPCs, so the game is exactly the same after 40 hours. If we were to fight this mission, the enemy gang is offering us twice as much money. I accepted it and put it twice in my pocket, I went back to the man I had betrayed and gave it again: DDDD No intrigue. It was a save that I improved a lot, I did not understand how it happened. I looked on the internet, many people experienced this. ----------------------------------------- What did I like about the game? + Perfect atmosphere that makes the war feel like it is real. + Excellent Graphics, I was amazed when I played it. + I enjoyed it very much when I sat down in the first two. ------------------------------------------ Well, are these two things enough now? ? Not enough. 8 years and 8 years, huge 8 years. Even my comparison is ridiculous, but the time allocated to this game is more than the time allocated to TLOU2. If anyone is thinking, save money, add more and get RDR2. "}

This game is called the battleground of the gods but you wont feel that instead you will feel regular cliche moba characters cosplaying as gods the theming of the game is unsuccesful. If you like mythological stuff dont play this game you will be dissapointed. I would love to see item names being Gungnir, Mjollnir, the sword of Atilla, the stolen lightning of zeus, seal of tartarus, poseidons trident, Freyr's sword mytical names instead of nonsense stuff in the game such as; stone cutting sword, executioner, deathbringer, rage, transendence that is some potential wasted right there. Game fails to present you a "battleground of the gods", and also fails to be a balanced  moba. Balance shouldnt be a big issue if you dont want to go competitive like me, but surely there are people who wants be competitive I can feel for them even without going ranked.  The only thing game will be succesful with is making tons of money because all the skins are hilariously expensive. In the case of being presented a fine skin, it will be exculusive to a chest which will require you to roll about 3-4 times and each roll costs as much as the worth of skin. Hi-Rez on behalf of the all users please "Balance your game". Edit: its 2020 I have much more playtime on this game now and I still stand by this review things are not changing for the good especially in the skins department I dont know when was the last time they added a skin that you could just buy instead new bundles, exlusive chests, random chests, chapter chests, chapter bundles all of the skins are in these now you cant even get to choose what you want to buy with your money "}

We regularly see anime borrow ideas from each other, but not Re: ZERO. Re: ZERO is borrowing, a fresh mix of millions of ideas. For me, this is a winner without competition in the competition. If you are not familiar with the anime industry, but decided to try to become part of the Kappa Pride society, then it is a good choice to start. Many [things / tricks] in the narrative will be unfamiliar to you. I have no doubt that you will like and you, even, will be happy to watch Re: ZERO, catching a datfil for a couple of days or weeks. But this is a very weak anime for any person who is already at least a little familiar with the industry.

{"text" : "This is the case when time passes and the game gets worse. In this review, I'll tell you why you shouldn't play this game. First, I will briefly describe the game, its main problems, and then we will analyze these problems. The game has a lot of problems, such as optimization, cheaters, community, "bug fixes", graphics, microtransactions, terrible rank system, terrible anti-cheat, hitboxes, and other minor problems (you can't count the problems in this game) I'll start with the first and the most the main problem: cheaters In my personal experience, I played three skating rinks, each of them had a twist. Someone will say: but there is a prime account. Yes, but to connect it you need to dial 21 levels. Okay, you might say that all valve games have problems with cheaters. No, only our "beloved" CSGO has such problems. I now want to compare CS: GO with TF2. In TF2, as soon as cheats were created (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥), valve a month later updated the anti-cheat and banned all cheaters. Nowadays it is rare to find cheaters, rarely one or two, but by half the round they are kicked with the inscription Disconnected from the game (VAC banned). And what about our "favorite" cop? We don't give a damn about cheaters, deal with them yourself, because we created a patrol. Yes, there is a patrol, but people do not need this patrol, if someone is watching demos, they skip them and put all the checkmarks. Community This is, of course, the problem of many games, but cs is the main bunch of mothers, the main class 2B hackers who will figure you out on the ip, Poles who shout their favorite word KURVA into the microwon, scammers, "about traders" who have a mind to throw you on the knife, cattle, about avapers, people who have P90 instead of hands, people who ponte skins on Silver 1 and other "very significant" people for society. Microtransactions Our "favorite" cs set trend-caseics for all games. Keysiki everywhere, knives, skins, gloves, music sets. Fuck. Boot skins coming soon. I paid $ 9.99 for this game, and it feels like I'm playing an F2P game. Bug fix There is nothing to say here. We fixed one bug and created two. Hitboxes are also bugs. How long will they be fixed? Dohaya. Awful rank system. Played for two days without interruption. Won 5 rink, lost one - lost the title. Terrible anti-cheat VAC bans you for a bad connection Grafon + optimization The game has not the best graphics at the moment. But sorry, 6th generation GTX750ti + I3 bundle is 30 fps. The game has weak graphics, but it produces such a minimum FPS at 1080p and all settings set to maximum. I hope you think well before buying this game. If I helped you, then I will be very glad "}

You usually only get gold, and there isn't really much to spend it on apart from books that are necessary to obtain ingredients for potions. So you HAVE to look for whoever sells them. I'm only going to complete it since I'm at the last parts of the game, but damn what an annoying experience. Oh yeah, the game crashed 7 times without me saving.

{"text" : "- Although it is a 2016 game, it is far behind in terms of Graphics and Mechanics compared to other fps games - Most of the maps are stolen, this cannot be ignored (from games such as Cs: go and Cod) - Although my system is very good, I have in-game fps drops - The sounds in the game Really amateurish and pretentious - Nobody's fair in this game, whoever has invested more money into the game, he's the king (Wolfteam logic) - The game's average age is 6-14 if you want to swear by the kids - It's a game for you - After playing for a long time, Aim im started to deteriorate + The plus side is that it is only a Turkish game. In my opinion, it is a total waste of time and quota. So do not play this game, look at the monitor like goods, you will have more fun.

{"text" : "This used to be my favorite game of all time. Not anymore ______________________________________ The current state of Team Fortress 2 right now is BAD You will see cheaters/hackers in casual matches and maybe competitive too The only way to play this game is by community servers, which I usually don't like them, because most of them have confusing plugins, level system, or even custom sounds and custom effects. If you're a new player, I suggest finding a good community server you are comfortable in and do NOT play casual mode as it is bombarded with hackers and VAC doesn't do anything. The community of Team Fortress 2 has also gotten worse. It is rare to find a FRIENDLY player nowadays and it is unwelcoming to new players, perhaps the in-game tutorial was not enough to teach them advanced techniques (Rocket Jumping, Sticky Jumping, etc). At last, I do not recommend to play this game, for now. You will face a lot of hackers if you play it right now. When Valve fixes the current issues, feel free to play this game! "}

They have plenty of time for making DLCS or skins, but they have no intention of finishing the actual game. Also they took away the good stuff from the first game that made it special, like being able to keep a door shut indefinately so long as there was someone who was better at their job than the things trying to break it down. There is no way to hold up anywhere and its monotonus with all the new maps they have because all you can do is run away and shoot. Find a circle to run in and do it until everything is dead. Stuff like that took the team play or the need to rely on teamates out of the game. Its sad to see what they have done with the game. One last thing, they put robots in a zombie game... Its pittiful.

I really like it that you can "feel" the medieval age. Respect for the Devs! But that is somehow all the positive things I can say. The mainstory seems to be interesting in the beginning, but it always ends with  ! They feel really stretched. Your decisions seem to matter in the beginning, but they don't (there are no BIG changes in the story). As I said, I can understand that they wanted to make the game as realisitc as possible, but any historical novel (books written by Bernard Cornwell for example) have a better stories to tell and still stay true to the source material. For sure it is not a Skyrim or any other action RPG and it always focuses on realism, but it is still a computergame. If I want to play a simulation, I play Euro Truck Simulator 2. It is hard to describe, but it always feels like that something is missing. The same happens to the sidequests. Some are really good - others are just terribad. Feels more like that they wanted to fill up the world with interesting things. Which takes me to the next point. The world is boring as hell. Sure, as I wrote in the beginning, the atmosphere is awesome, but most of the time you see nothing. You are excited of what you are going to see and what will happen on your journey, but nothing happens. The fighting system makes fun, even if its a bit hard to undestand in the beginning. There is only one problem. The enemies are so stupid. You can easily fight them off by just letting them stuck in a door. While they try to get trough the door (which never works when they draw their swords) you just beat them to a plulp. One after another. The "stuck in the door"-thing is actually a bug. Which takes us to the next part of my review: Thhe ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ glitches. They are sometimes unbearable. Everytime when I think that this could be my game of the year they just occur and destroy the immersion. - Corpses flying into the air for no reason (during a fight). - NPCs flying into the air for no reason and died. - Getting to close to NPCs causes them to disappear. - I can pickpocket people out in the open even if another NPC sees me.  - Sometimes (this is really rare!) when I start to lockpick, NPCs can see me even if there is a wall in between. - Quests that can be finished while glitching around (in the beginning you have to get out of a castle - glitchjump over a fence - there is an invisible wall - and you have saved alot of time). - NPCs that stuck in the door. - The protagonist stucks in the door (jumping like a ♥♥♥♥ works). - The watertexture bugs around sometimes (only at dawn). - If you kill someone while that person is sleeping, it just bugs trough the floor. I want to like this game. I really want. And for sure I am going to change my review to positive if the bugs are gone. But for now, it feels like a big disappointment. "}
{"text" : "At the moment, for the full price, it's not worth it. The game still has some performance issues, but they are fixing it with frequent updates. For anyone who has played the Arkham series and expects a story on the same level, you will be disappointed with the story of that game, but it is not bad, just short. Currently, it is a mixed feeling, but what predominates is the disappointment for having expected a game that bears that name and not being able to play and have fun due to technical problems. A comment aside, almost an outburst, is that it seems that the company brought the mistakes of Shadow of The Tomb Raider to this game too ... Too bad, because Tomb is one of my favorite game series, and Avengers, carries a weight in the name that is hard to please most fans, especially with doing what they did with this game. I don't think the game has a Destiny touch, I liked that, but the problem is to launch the game that way.

{"text" : "Auto-moto-bike-photo-fucking-rowing-and-hunting-TV and radio monitors. The game tries to be both a stealth and a shooter, and an RPG, and an action game, and God knows what else. As a result, none of these elements are done well. And all together it works and completely shitty. It is not clear why there are so many skills and opportunities for the stealth branch, if, by and large, it is not effective at all. Well, really, what is the sacred meaning of hiding from monsters, turning into mugs, chairs and all kinds of other rubbish? To leave enemies behind and then bump into them, or so that they appear from behind at the most inopportune moment? A shooter or an action game is also not very good, because just here there is not enough variety in the tools. The simplest winning tactic is to flood the enemy with a plaster cannon and then whip. And carry with you disposing grenades in case of meeting with someone large. And that's all - the rest can only be pumped to a heap, according to the residual principle. From the point of view of graphics, everything is not bad, architecturally the station is made in places very stylish and interesting, in some way it all resembles Bioshock, but does not hold out to it with the atmosphere and depth of the general concept. But the creation of navigation among all these floors, modules and compartments, the map and interface solutions, was clearly done by some gay gay. It is very difficult to find a way here at least somewhere, especially if there are more than one quests at the same time: the map does not help much, the direction indication is completely confusing. Regarding the plot and the whole game. The beginning was intriguing, I was glad that you need to collect a lot of things not just like that, but in order to get the necessary materials, craft, and in general, how cool the perception of the room changes when any thing in it can turn out to be a mimic that will explode with its tentacles in your face - cool girl! But after 20-30 minutes the wow-effect disappears, there is nothing to surprise the game with - and nothing is wrong. And then everything rolls into shitty running around "reboot-the reactor-go-get-fix-give-hug-kiss-where-the-salary-told-me-mother-don't-go-out-for an alcoholic-all-my-my-life-fucked-up-bastard ". Longing is green, in short. 90 percent of the characters at the station died, that is, not very much alive. And those who are alive do not differ much from corpses in terms of expressiveness of faces, clarity of motivations and interesting stories. In the end, it becomes inexpressibly boring, you want to run faster to the end and complete this "adventure" with at least something. It didn't seem like a bad start, but at the same time for me the project was a big disappointment at the end. It is impossible to say unequivocally that the game is bad, but it is definitely not worth taking it for the full price. And it is better to wait for a big sale, think it over again and then decide.

{"text" : "And this game tapped out all those opportunities with me. PROS: + Rogue-like levels promise every game run to be unique + Graphics look decent for a budget indie game + A few well-done spooky moments  CONS: - Jump scares galore quickly outstay their welcome and impact - Bad use of sound effects that additionally dull the atmosphere - Game shows you everything it's got in the first couple of levels Dungeon Nightmares II The Memory (needs longer title, ffs) tells a story about the kid stuck on the hotel floor and constantly having day-nightmares. When you are in the hotel, your room is a "safe-space" where you can take a break, discover more of the ongoing story, gather your thoughts and think why you're wasting your time on crap horror games, before you enter the elevator and go into basement/dungeons where all bets are off. To leave a basement level, you have to find and activate the power box, find at least one note of importance and exit by locating another elevator room. All basement levels are randomized mazes made out of bricks, just with different color and texture as you reach deeper levels. Majority of sounds are intentionally subdued and quiet, except for every screech, scream or attack that is purposefully loud to scare you. There are a lot of random "gotcha" jumpscare moments that aren't really threatening. Your stamina is signalized by the rhythm of your heartbeat, and health by the blurry redness of your vision, You only have one real threat that will occasionally chase you and will kill you quickly if it's nearby. You have unreliable candles to push this active threat away for a short time, but you have to find them first, there's too few of them and they might not activate on your first try when you need them. When you manage to leave a level, you loose all your spare candles, you keep the keys of other hotel rooms that will progress the story. If this sounds like Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion knock off to you, that's because it probably is. The amount of cheap jumpscares in this game is through the roof, they feel lazy and effortless, there's no momentum nor build up to the scare. It's all instant-gratifying and bland scares that will spike your adrenocorticotropic before your brain acclimatize and start ditching these cheap moments of horror. There are a handful few well made horror moments: the eerie images on the walls and the thing that is chasing you are really unnerving, but everything else is forgetful. The sewer like design of levels that have no atmosphere nor personality also does not help in leaving a chilling, memorable gaming experience. Avoid it unless you want to jump out of your chair in the first 3 minutes and then uninstall it. "}

{"text" : "Rusty Lake has long been doing a series of interconnected puzzle quests in an unusual setting of near-horror, where all devilry happens and there is dismemberment, but there is no particular emphasis on horror, the overall style is rather light and colorful, and the stories of the heroes are tragic. It turns out a kind of bizarre phantasmagoria without words and with gameplay "find a way out of the room." The logic of the tasks is unearthly in places, but we did not get to the guides (there are few objects, and in extreme cases, you can simply "click" everything). All studio games are made primarily for mobile platforms, and on a computer, the interface, sharpened for paging the screen in touch mode, is frankly lame. The authors also broke the fullscreen with the next patch, two years ago they promised to fix it, but apparently they did not reach their hands, the game now works forever only in the window. In principle, the game is not bad, and fans of the genre can quite try it (especially since it costs mere pennies on sales), but I personally cannot say what I liked, and there is no particular desire to watch other games of the same studio. Similar to wonderful turning mechanisms, in my opinion, a cut above. "}

{"text" : "The dream I rocked myself several times in my childhood - a possible fusion of Total War and Warhammer - turned out to be a nightmare. This silly and confusing game is unworthy of both saga and saga. - Artificial intelligence is inadequate. Both in the countryside and in battle. -Battles that are resolved in a couple of minutes in which any form of planning is useless and even the basic paper-rock-scissors logic is practically absent. The most expensive troops beat the least expensive ones, the rest is irrelevant. - Bad campaign, but bad: the management elements are reduced to the bone, we are not talking about diplomacy. There is very little to do, little to build, and little to design. Anyone who loves strategy games will find it banal and simplistic. -The game is heavy and requires a machine of a certain level to run properly, yet the graphics are bad, although usually TW does not disappoint on this point and the GW miniatures are gorgeous. Everything is a bit sloppy, badly lit, out of focus. Personally, it almost gives me a headache (or is it "just" depression?). Ultimately, this is the worst Total War I've ever come across. I find absolutely no compelling reason to prefer it to any of its predecessors, and I don't recommend it to Warhammer fans either (for whom the disappointment could be double). "}

{"text" : "I am going to do a very brief review of what I found in the game ... ►: 5/10 The story does not seem to me to be wrong, it is more a background of what happened to a girl because she suffered acts of bullying, It can be intriguing on the one hand but sadly the story is not well matched by the game itself. It is not so common to see this type of content in a horror game because horror stories are always accompanied by other types of factors, either: satanic pacts, mental disorders such as psychosis, depression, dementia, etc. ►: 3/10 The graphics are quite disappointing, even though they are made with the Unity graphics engine, one expected a little more from them. I could take a risk and say that slenderman looks better, but a lot of work was lacking in the graphic section ►: 2/10 The environment wants to make you think that you are in constant danger or capable that at any moment a good screamer will come to you ... But none of that happens, I was waiting a long time waiting for something to happen and the truth is that nothing ever happened. I saw many who say the game is full of jumpscares but I don't know if they really played the game. I made it to the very end and I only had 10 jumpscare and out of those 10, 2 were really good and unexpected, but the game fails even at that honestly. Mentioning something else about the environment, it's all very dark ... Honestly, you can't see a grove where you go and more in the cave, finding the objects seems like an impossible mission and not even telling them when they get to the square and for some strange reason they Bugeen the lights and stay in the dark in places where you do not understand how you got there (or how to get out). ►: 3/10 Repetitive music, you hear the restart cuts as well as the same noises that try to "scare you" or "worry you" and once you are on the same stage for 9 minutes that effect is gone, you don't do it again feel and it takes a lot of "terror" out of the game. ►: 3/10 The player's movements feel pretty rough, they're not bad at all but I think they could have worked better on it. Finding keys repeatedly makes the game bored at some point, very hidden objects in a totally dark environment that not even turning the brightness up to the maximum could find them ... And yes, I raised the brightness to maximum, I restarted the game several times and the picture improved very little. As well as an inventory that I wonder what it's on for, if it can't even really be used just like looking at in-game collectibles. ►: 4/10 The duration of the game is short, with passing it once it can take you between 3-4 hours unless it is difficult for you to find the objects ... For my part I was 20 min. locked in a dark cave where you can't see the objects, a square where they make you look for a tool and even more the bug of the lights that dim in the game makes it very difficult to find the objects. For a game that is worth AR $ 13.99, I think durability is fine, but highlighting the points already mentioned, durability will vary, as it can take you 2 hours it can also take you 9 hours ... ►: 3/10 The game never exposes you to difficult challenges, in fact, I could tell you that the most difficult thing is not to screw the game but seriously ... There are no puzzles. There are no chases (worth escaping). There are no screamers that make you back down to the point that you don't want to keep moving forward. Honestly, this game is missing a lot of things for it to really be classified as a Horror game, it is not enough to put a dark environment and put an old woman who is badly animated and constantly bugging.

{"text" : "5+ hours of stupidity, which would be 10 GUFOF out of 10. Comments: Are you serious? A story about two doctors? These are the two who were shown for the first 10 minutes, then they had a fight in the middle for 10 minutes and at the end they shouted something for a "deep" meaning ?! Do you seriously think the game is about them? 30-40 minutes out of 5 hours of "gameplay"? They were probably so well revealed that they sunk into your heart and made you empathize with them. No, this is far from a "story of two" doctors "" Further. The essence of the plot is "all" rip "- most clearly reflects what is happening there. Here it is necessary to dot the mute over and. 1. The plot is about two doctors. Hell, because: It gives nothing (except as a kind of fucking insight affairs, there could just as well have been aliens / books (aka just a story, damn it !!!) / any other cliche, from any other movie or game, but there are thousands of them); annoying (with a fucking chaff and type of pseudointelligence and bloat); And in the end, the principle is not needed there (because anything better and better than these 2 super-flat characters could cope with this task) Rating: 2 out of 10 for referring to old file fantasy. 2. The plot of the situation itself at the time of the passage (i.e. That is, the grandfather is in a coma) The failure is complete (!!!), because: At the time of the arrival of the "doctors" / 2x fuck the grandfather in a coma and near death. That is, in fact, his consciousness as a person is completely absent. - HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE NIH AND HIM, WHAT IS HAPPENING TO HIM, ALLO !!! This means that at best, that he looks itson (the "doctors" themselves say this) And the meaning of this, damn it, is a little more than completely absent! Think about it! It's totally fucked up. The plot moves where the fuck is not needed. On fingers. Grandfather sleeps, sees a dream where everything, as it turns out in his life, is shitty than he thought (about this separately) and DIES. In a dream. Sleep. Sleep, fuck, sobai. All. Conc. Neither relatives, who would have been told / interested, nor he because he is dead, nor his wife for the same reason, only 2 dunce, who, in principle, do not need this fuck because this is their job. All. That's where this story came from. Rating: 0/10 (this part of the plot simply DOESN'T MAKE SENSE !!! And this, just, and kills the MAIN plot, about it later). 3. BASIC (for your information, my dear connoisseur of deep blowjobs (plots)) PLOT (ie the very subconscious / grandfather's memories) There are no pretensions here. Everything is well written, 2 cool plot twists, good presentation, no questions. But. Does it bother you? Well, I'm talking about plots based on "amnesia". Well, okay, this is purely my, subjective opinion on this part. I don’t know about you, gentlemen, but I was pretty sick of "dog's dreams" (Google this term. There was a site where games / films / books built on this cliché are collected. There are thousands of them there.) The ending of the main plot is just a fiasco. What the fuck is an astronaut? Really? Why? The answer is simple - see # 2. Rating: 6/10 (it was / saw / started. Flight to the moon - wtf ?!) And we get such an idea of ​​ourselves from tick, jaded tricks, brain cancer because of nonsense, what is happening, but a good love story and tragedy with a pinch of humor and an even lesser pinch of originality. Conclusion: 300 rubles for a working game, which is praised by every dog ​​that does not know how to analyze and is fucking sensitive to snot, such a pleasure. Overrated. Not bad but GREAT overvalued. Here is the FULL review on thm, which I presented in the review above, in the recommendation itself. Is everyone happy? Me not. Zs consumed "}

{"text" : "Very good game and very good community, everyone worries about telling you your mistakes so that you can improve, which is a bit strange, how can their own self not see them with the screen off? There are a lot of pro people who make new accounts to help new ones to rise and it is not at all to increase their self-esteem. Also I have found that everyone "used to be double ak". And finally there are the people who have greatly improved their way of playing with third-party programs, what clever people, really, how can the pros not think of using these programs? They clearly make you play better, it's the future of eSports. My favorite map of the competitive pool is Militia ... How ?, What is not ?, then Cobblestone ... Neither ?. I especially liked the latest box they have released, the CS20. It's great how they have ignored the good skins that were in the workshop to put all ugly weapons except an awp that is almost the howl, and a glob that should be a usp. The Hallowen update was also cool, really. Another thing that I like is that the partner games do not appear in "my games", and having to go to look for them in my library, game statistics and there to look at the games, it's cool. And the people who add me to my other account inviting me to "tournaments", or to a business / skin page, or people who pass me questionable links in general. I like that they no longer take out more operations, total, nobody liked it (?). I am very amused by the partner mode, where I can play in supreme against some silver that have been boosted to global, or against people who use wallhack, but since they do not know how to shoot anyway, then nothing happens, it makes people feel good arriving to a range that has no value in that mode. So you can tell people, hey, look, guys, I'm supreme! And then if you whisper with your very very small mouth: as a partner, because in competitive I don't get to Nova 2. Well, that's all, to continue enjoying the game, and remember, it is always better to annoy colleagues when they do something Too bad to try to play as a team and give them warm advice, that always works. And if you can shoot them or troll the game so that they develop a strong character, much better! A greeting. "}

{"text" : "Here is Shadow of the Tomb Raider, the third game of the reboot Tomb Raider series. Frankly, I knew that the game was not very good before I bought the game, but I loved SOTTR for 66 TL just to finish the series. I played a worse game than I expected, neither to lie. Same as the previous game, same brother. The guys have changed the never-ending place and wrote a very cliché and concocted Tomb Raider story. Is this really the game you made? The mechanics, animations and stuff are the same as before. A few new features have been added, but these are not enough to call a new game. The action sequences in the game have decreased considerably. I finished it in 9.5 hours and the action parts in this process were really less than the general. The puzzles are designed according to the intelligence level of the primary school child, neither enjoyable nor challenging. His story is what annoys me the most. Brother could only write such a shitty, callous story. Gene Trinity is after something and we're trying to stop them. We take over the Artifact and the cliché is Trinity taking over etc. I don't know what else I can say for the story. Even its beginning and end are the same as before. We start again with a vehicle accident, we are fighting the last battle in a surreal event and it is over. The boss fight is only at the end, by the way. Unless you count the shitty leopard at the beginning of the game, of course. The only fun parts were the rare action sequences. The end of the game was all action. If the end of the game was like the general one, I would leave with swearing, but luckily, it didn't leave a shit-like taste in my mouth thanks to a little activity, but it couldn't prevent it from leaving a bad taste. There is no event at the end, by the way, I am happy to say that there is only action. I have not attempted the side events yet, and I do not plan to participate in the side events because they were quite boring in previous games. Anyway, if I itemize the cons and score them: Cons: -Extremely shitty scenario, -Same to the previous game -The graphics sometimes look like shit, even at the top -Puzzles are bad, action sequences are low, -Characters are not very good optimization.

It has a very meh Gunplay, it does not seem that you carried a sniper with you. It is practically no different from the pistol. And it's really screwed up, because it's a Sniper game. AI is the most incoherent and boring thing I have ever experienced, in this game there is no tension at all. And finally, a rather cliché story, with a lot of plot twist of "They have betrayed you!" However, visually there are very beautiful scenarios. Too bad the game is so linear and can't be exploited enough. The best moments in the game are the mission pair where they give you the freedom to play however you want on a wide stage, but 90% is "Follow this", "Shoot this", "Defend this". A huge mistake, because there are two mechanics that could have been used a lot, the one from, but they only appear that time. It is a game that can entertain a while, being free.

{"text" : "Garbage! Only got this because of humble bundles outrageous monthly deal but this is just simply put a bad game. I bought it on my Play Station and sold it immediately and giving it a second chance was one of the biggest wastes of my time. Only thing that I could see they put any sort of effort into was the graphics but that really doesn't mean much to me if the games garbage. I'll start off with the technical aspects before I start tearing this game a new one. On the technical aspects it surprisingly has in depth video settings that actually show the difference without you having to go in game to see its effects with G-Sync actually working out the gate but the random hitching in this game can get aweful at times. It really just seems to be poor optimisation of some sort and my rig is more than capable of turning everything to the max and playing at very smooth frame rates but the hitching is just annoying.  Story is as cooky cutter and cliche as you'd expect from a COD post Black Ops 2. I was really excited to get that feeling that your just one man on a battlefield when I heard Cod was going back to its routes with you and the supporting cast being vulnerable to death but I soon realised this is just another COD title were you play as a demi-god, it lacks the any sort of uniqueness the PS2 games had and throws out any sort of realism right out of the window. Let me list all the things wrong with the campaign as I think it just isn't even worth playing regardless if you got it off the Humble Bundle or not, starting off with: 1) Them desperately playing it safe, completely avoiding racism entirely which was rampart in this time period 2) Just felt like a Disney version of what actually happened. They only really gloss over some of the horrors of what truly went down on the final mission but it felt toned down anyway   3) shoe horned British female on the front lines just to shove in more SJW propaganda. It isn't Battlefield 5 bad but I can tell the difference between having SJW agenda and not 4) Poor QTE's that just slow down the narrative to a halt and if your caught off guard by it, they can kill you fairly quickly which is just annoying 5) Disgustingly linear sections RIDDLED with unnecessary invisible walls and feeling embarrassingly less open than a game made over 9 years ago (COD WAW) 6) Too focused on copying the success of EA's Battlefield 1 which I think is highly overrated and Treyarch instead of making anything unique or worth playing  Honestly just play World at War if you actually want a better world war gaming experience and better campaign in general. This was just a joke. I tried the multiplayer and put it down so quick that I wouldn't even be able to give you a review, same goes for zombies which Imo are both absolute garbage.  I'll give the game a 5/10, its just a soulless cash grab. Everything about this game was done poorly and has been done better before it. So happy Sledgehammer were cut out for making 2020's COD. It would've been a wasted year for COD fans. "}

By the way, FPS is limited to 30 frames. Why, I have no idea. Soap kat-scheny - possibly due to the fact that there was not a native permission. Yes, the enemies see the sniper in the bushes, but they don't see the fighter who is standing nearby. It is difficult to explain, perhaps due to the effect of surprise - here I appeared, ran abruptly and the enemy got scared and lost control of the visual apparatus.

An apple takes up the same space as a gasoline canister or an assault rifle. - certain objects on the ground that cannot be picked up for some reason. - obviously the biggest flaw in this kind of game is obviously the players who still haven't understood that survival doesn't mean killing everyone. - the 60 seconds to be disconnected from the server (where is the logic besides?) after being killed, then the loading which crashes, the game which crashes and to finish in style the impossibility of reconnecting me to the game because my gaming session is still active.

{"text" : "I don't recommend it mainly because of the gameplay, or rather, the lack of it. I remember Rainbow Six Vegas 2, 8 years ago, which had a singleplayer story mode with the possibility of cooperation, very solid and variable PvE and PvP modes, with wide difficulty levels, multiple maps, various tactical game options, customization of avatar, progression system that, as your level went up, gave you the right to new weapons, devices, camouflage ... it was a spectacular game at its peak! It still is, if we compare it to the gameplay of Rainbow Six Siege (obviously the graphics of the time are very outdated today). Currently, things have changed a lot and for the worse! The story mode, which was long and comprehensive in Vegas 2, becomes non-existent in Siege. The closest to a story that comes is through tutorial missions and half-mouthed and only. The wide-ranging cooperative mode of the past has also died, and today it has only one mode that is extremely repetitive (Terrorist Hunt), possible to be played alone but totally unrecommended to do because of the annoyance that ends up becoming. The multiplayer (PvP) mode, even being between teams, looks like one-on-one because you can't trust your brainless partners, you end up becoming a better player alone. Avatar customizations and tactical settings have all gone downhill as well, as they all now share the same unlockable characters and make it impossible to use more than one type of character per team simultaneously (it turns into a race to see who ends up taking your favorite character) first). If the game has any positive point that pays off to be worthwhile, it is certainly the latest generation graphics. Very beautiful indeed, impeccable physics, it looks like a cinema thing. Unfortunately, games nowadays are not taken into account only in the graphics, as it is the only point where there is any prominence. A pity that such an ambitious and promising game has become one of these free PvPs, which focus entirely on shootings, explosions and pre-made classes, but which completely alienates the true essence of the Tom Clancy franchise: captivating stories, warlike customization an inspiring teamwork even for those who prefer to be a lone wolf (Splinter Cell). PS: Rainbow Six Siege has a weapon customization mode for each class individually, but it is so mouthpiece that I didn't think it deserved to be mentioned ... I doubt whether I consider it a neutral or negative point, because it is certainly not a positive for the superficiality that was given to him. "}

{"text" : "Few games hold true potential to be something amazing. This is one of those games that has amazing moments of suspense, thrill, fear, and fun, all bundled together in a nice package with a bow on top. The problem is that these moments are absolutely buried beneath what I can only hypothesize as general negligence in the creation of this game. The only way that this product released in the state it's in is with clueless developers, or a forced release date that resulted in a product being shoved out the door way too early. "But it just came out of beta" is the excuse I've seen given by many trying to justify their purchase and hold on tightly to the fact that an early investment wasn't a mistake. As someone who backed the Kickstarter, I am wholeheartedly let down at the fact this game is less balanced than a sinking ship. The fact Jason can inconsequentially teleport on top of counselors in plain sight, rapidly break through doors in seconds, can swing faster than a ninja whilst counselors cannot hit me whatsoever (this is a claim. Jason can power-walk through attacks), and is invulnerable during ALL of his interactive animations is completely and totally unacceptable in any form of release. There is no semblance of balance that went into the creation of this game. I'm under the impression that there was no actual testing was ever in the development process beyond "we can ship it." I'm genuinely pissed off that the F13 IP is being treated this poorly. The only thing that works as intended in the "Add to Cart" button on the store page. At $40 I want something I could at least pretend is functional. Until then, this is on par with the 1989 "Friday the 13th" Nintendo game release. Please, for the love of God if you guys want some help; contact me. I'll fix your ♥♥♥♥ for free. I want this game to be good. I want my review to change. Update #1: Cleaned up comments section to remove useless snark from beggars. For clarity's sake, I'm fully aware of the attempt of asymmetrical attempt at Jason being overpowered. I think most of you are missing the point I'm trying to make. It should be aimed at a 50/50 winrate when you have a competent Jason against 8   counselors. Eight people should rival a singular rival entity. A weak link in the team should lower the chances of success, decreasing further for each lesser skilled counselor since you're forced into a team environment. The only wild cards are the drop locations and escape options. Also to clarify about Jason and how he "is supposed to be overpowered"; sure. He's supposed to blatantly overpower a singular character but that's not what I'm trying to address. The problem is that as it stands the gameplay is that Jason's abilities allow people to feel cheated out of playtime. The ability to shift/morph directly on top of a player isn't acceptable. There is not a singular piece of counterplay to this aside from hoping you have a pocketknife. This means you're fundamentally reliant on finding a drop which so incredibly unlikely happen if Jason targets you first. I have not personally lost a game as Jason when I shift on top of people. This is a problem playing Jason is legitimately a leisurely stroll. I can also confirm at you are invulnerable in contextual animation as Jason, so... not sure how that's a thing people are disputing. Also if you all haven't figured out my playtime stems from finding specific exploits to report so they're addressed faster, well, you should probably get off the review and go help find more errors to report. Lastly, the database and server connection bug is relatively unforseeable. I've never had an issue with it its existence as that's just the nature of development. This game blew up fast so you can't really fault developers for consequences that result in unknown population growth. Also price tag would be fine if balanced was addressed. Three maps with randomization is fine. The content is fine. The experience is not. "}

{"text" : "I usually don't play games for almost 20 hours and follow that up with a negative review, but I felt like I had to play this game for longer to see if it got better, and it didn't. It starts out very interesting but quickly deflates, and I say that as someone who loves crafting and farming games. If I had to describe Portia in one word, it would be: soulless. The entirety of the game doesn't feel like any soul or passion was really put into it. It's very hard to explain, but the longer I played, the more I felt like the game was lacking a soul. The gameplay is very grindy - put down machines, craft stuff, fulfill commerce orders - which is fine for a farming/crafting game like this, but everything just takes so damn long to earn, you never feel like you are making any progress at all. The game feels simply disjointed. Everything takes way too long. I have played the game for only two ingame months and am not even close to being friends with any of the townspeople despite regular gifts. Smelting just 25 iron bars takes over two ingame days, which is a ridiculous amount of time for a somewhat early-game resource, even if you consider putting down multiple furnaces. There isn't really any sense of progress when everything moves slower than a snail with arthritis.  There are also some design flaws. Some materials can only be found as rare completely random drops from mining in the abandoned ruins, so if you are unlucky, you are going to be searching days for just one specific material. The people living in the town aren't interesting. At times the game feels like it should still be in Early Access, with people falling through the ground, mining in the ruins looking very weird and several other problems. You can move some machines on your farm, for others you have to go to a building in the town to access a menu to move and upgrade them. And they close at 18:00 ingame time. Why? Simply put, Portia fails to nail the balance between grind, progress and accomplishment and everything just feels soulless. The townspeople have a dead stare in their eyes, many voice lines aren't recorded and the game is clearly unfinished and lacking in many, many QOL improvements.  It was fun enough at first but quickly loses steam and the longer I played, the more I just wanted to play any other farming or crafting sim, like Stardew Valley, Factorio or similar. Can't really recommend the game and I don't think the followup they are currently developing will be much better. "}

{"text" : "Is that a thumbs down? Yup. But don't let that fool you. This is still a great game, but there's reasons. Let me explain. The Negatives: Epic has risen it's evil head and forced Psyonix to ruin the item system, ♥♥♥♥ over it's customer base, and (in turn) hurt the community it built. Before Season 5, crates were awarded that could be unlocked with a key that was $1 assuming you bought 5+ keys. This gave you a random item of varying quality, just like any standard loot crate, or more comparatively, CS-GO's crate system. Once Season 5 hit, they introduced blueprints, which you would get after random matches. These blueprints could be an item of any varying quality. However, it now costs credits to create those items, price being dependent on the quality of an item. For instance, a common item would be 100 credits, and Black Market items would be 2000 credits. The problem? 100 Credits = $1, or in comparison, 1 key. That means you need TWENTY keys to make a Black Market item. While, it's possible you could not get a Black Market item within 20 keys in the old system, you still got 20 other items of varying quality for your vehicles. Terrible, right? To make matters worse, Psyonix/Epic decided to spit on their community further by recently releasing price adjustments using a standard scumbag practice of pricing super high, only to mark it down to a price that still scams their customer base, but appears like a good deal because of the significant price drop, allowing (dumb) customers to think they're actually getting a deal and forgetting that they gained so much more via the old system.  The Positives: The game itself is still good. Gameplay is fun and competitive, the content they create is great, the mini events are fun and rewarding, and the Season Pass still rewards with great items.  TL;DR: Game is awesome, Company and it's practices are ♥♥♥♥. "}

A game in which we are seen as bags of money (because in this game absolutely everything is sold for crystals, except for a couple of shit skins and champions for a crazy amount of gold) Want a battle pass? Buy it! Do you want a beautiful skin that you like? Buy it! Do you want buns for participating in the event? Buy a skin in the event, for this you will receive a key that gives you access to buy another skin, only it is already 2 times more expensive, or for a gold coin from the legendary boss, which you will never meet, because he is very rare (legendary) ... Want an event item? Fig you! You haven't bought a skin! In my opinion, the game is much worse than it was before. You can see a devil-may-care attitude on your face, and when you play this game you will come across this more than once (because the developers have not fixed anything yet and are not going to fix it.) It's a pity to see that this game has followed in the footsteps of snickering studios. Very sorry. "}

I am actively skating in Dert 2 now and it is so pleasant to play it compared to 5 that somehow I did not expect. Well, in a year, Kodmasters, as a rule, will have fat discounts and updates. So far, in general, not so hot. And after the Rally it's too casual. Although in some places it looks very impressive, but the picture without gameplay is still somehow weak to eat. I have all Dertas and I remember how 4Ku was hated at the beginning, although as for me it came out very successful with some reservations, but then it was brought to mind. I hope it will be the same here and in half a year or a year we will meet again. We return to Rally 2. "}

{"text" : "With a new chapter, it is impossible to play for maniacs, not only do you have to wait until the lobby is created for 3-5 minutes, so then you have to wait until 4 surprises fly to you, and then it becomes even more interesting, as an endless attraction begins with incoming and outgoing surprises from lobby, because they brought in an incredible selection system for the most appropriate ping, which, as always, does not work correctly. In total, on average, you have to wait about 10 minutes in order to just start playing. And it will be very lucky if an endless download does not happen or someone simply does not crash or some new bug does not appear, yes, with each new update there are more and more of them. Old bugs are not fixed, and new bugs appear even faster than the developed ones are sawing new skins, because they are so important for a comfortable game (sarcasm). There used to be a pretty good system for creating a lobby and matching players, why destroy what actually worked in this game. WHAT FOR?! I really liked this game, but what our favorite developers are doing with it does not go into any gate. The game has become a simulator of waiting and generating bugs. Take pity on your time and do not waste your life on this game. P.S. They brought back the old matchmaking system, oh miracle, less than a minute and I collected a lobby for mana, hurray! I keep abreast of events: D I will correct it for the "recommend" rating when the bugs are fixed. "}
{"text" : "Something lately the game completely disappoints me. And so the trips rolled out another New Year's update to us, the atmosphere of the holiday? New winter map? Don't you, keep a card with halloween and cthulhu style. All games have a new year, and we have halloween twice. New maps are gluing together of old maps, all the same walls of the mansion, the same arches, maze bushes. In the * new map * you recognize several old ones at once, and you understand that you are ... And with such crap, you are stuffed with almost every update. There is no desire to enter the game, the eyes are not happy with the old maps ... but you can find new places in the map, but it is perceived as - yeah, I saw it cool, clear and that's it. Another new boss in the game, there is now the Patriarch and the Matriarch. What's so special about her? Yes, nothing, the tactics are the same. Event tasks, announcement of the first New Year's costume. The backside, well, what, the cybarpunk suit was a reward for the tasks, and on the New Year's backside. The tasks themselves are sharpened on solo skating rinks, since it is better to lure mobs into traps in the salary. Personally kill 10 Matriarchs, so that there are no competitors, you also go solo. A random% of the appearance of the Mother herself, also throws firewood into an already blazing fart !! It seems that I was tied to the game in order to pass the event, I have to roll and roll praying to God randomly when Mother falls out. And a sparkler, for what it is all - a skin on FN FAL, when there must be a suit! As a result of the new update that we have, a new model of the boss with a couple of its gags and a sent holiday atmosphere. Storage (things for crit.inov) - all sorts of gimmicks that do not harmonize with either the appearance of the characters or the cards. I take into account that it is a humor to dress a Persian like a kitty. Well, what, GTA loves it. But I do not understand why it is soooo accentuated, it is straightforward to shove idiotic things into the game. But a joke said twice will not get any funnier. This case itself is overflowing with this nonsense, but skins for weapons are also brought there. As a result, you have to go through the repeated madness of things in order to get a new product. A matter of principle, purely collection. Prestige - the policy is this, you want another skin in the collection and a class badge to stand out in public, throw off the skills to us to tell that you are used to skating only in hell with adequate teamplay, really it was impossible to issue these skins for inflicting damage or healing ... and hell with him would change the icon. It will stand out in the public - cool gear and skins for a donation, but if you shove through the trade, you can dress up stylishly for a small amount. Personally, I like the Persian to come up with a style, but I understand perfectly. Want to stand out? show a cool game. Everyone will understand what kind of impact you are making into it. I realized this back in 1kf, where all this was not there. The filter of things in the game itself was not updated even once, in the abundance of all this you spend a lot of time. I would like to save my assemblies, the so-called sets of things. That is, to scatter everything to your liking. Did you like how this mask looks with this hat? No, you won't wear .... there is no such algorithm that these 2 things would be combined together, either this or that. A random appearance would be cool, you click and the game itself dresses the Persian as it wants and shows what kind of thing it is and how it is worth. What for? What are you doing? We will glue cards from event to inventory and litter your inventory further. Spraying - accumulating different chirps and flash drives? too dusty, because too lazy to sell? They never brought a new drop there, as the same thing fell out that 3 years ago that right now. In fact, you drive dust in a circle. And partly you begin to understand why the policy of the developers has become tougher, well, since they roll out Halloween in the new year and to pass the event, you were forcibly tied to roll and roll! Because they fucked up the game with the shit further, I opened the flash drives at 150-160r (I don't give a shit about the dollar exchange rate, the fact itself) right now, I don’t open them at 100 .. so I’m going off on tickets. Yes, they were able to raise online games, thereby killing the game itself. But when he was not there, it was possible to climb the grandmas in the game and the beautiful and cool cards were brought in. Vicious circle dudes thanks for your attention !! "}
{"text" : "Not really a thumbs up or down (leaning more to down because of forced PvP), just a 4.5/10 experience with the game. I play the game with some friends, but would go solo when they aren't around. I've been attacked by a majority of players I meet. I've ever only managed to defend my solo sloop against another ship a few times, but have practically no chance against bigger ships. TLDR, if you have friends to play with all the time, it's an alright game. If you're thinking about going solo, you might want to skip this game. "}
{"text" : "In short, the essence of the game is the struggle between two races for the best. Indie strategy game in which you have to choose survival tactics. I want to list all the main advantages and disadvantages of the game. -the game has variability of development, which does not make the game linear; -There is an opportunity to compete with your friends; - nice pixel graphics made in a retro style. -the story mode is no different from the game mode against AI (except that the first has a splash screen at the beginning); -Lack of translation and localization for the game (those who do not speak English at a basic level will experience considerable difficulties during the game); -AI always makes a move after the player, which, in my opinion, is unfair and generates a twist. Despite all the advantages and the full potential of the game, I can say that it is boring and, as it seems to me, requires improvement. For example, you could make some interesting plot in story mode, more variability in survival, more races, more buildings. And although the game costs only 30 rubles, in my opinion, it would be inappropriate to spend time on it. At least while it is in this "unfinished" state. "}

{"text" : "TLDR: Do not get fooled by a price. You could easily find more enjoyable games and with more content via the Internet in a form of flash games. Details: 0 - 2 minutes of playtime - Wow, this may be good! 2 - 5 minutes of playtime - Dying and destroying, dying and destroying... 6 minutes of playtime - Oh, this is getting boring. Shooting over and over again... 7 minutes of playtime - No, I can not stand playing this any longer + Graphics looks are unique and somehow nice. + Concept seems to be good, it did not work here though. - No tutorial or any tips or explanation of what the game is about - simple "click here to play" and nothing else. - No setting options other than a single thing: "Press "F" to toggle Full screen". This actually gave me a lot of laugh - I think it was supposed to be a joke or something. - However graphics look nice, as for a person with bad eyesight, it was really difficult to see anything. All these shooting, crashing boxes, tanks and other things were floating around making everything a big mess. Everything was hard to be seen. - Only one basic vehicle/tank available to play, NO starting options or customization. - Gameplay is extremely boring already after few minutes of playing - it is just holding left mouse button and using keys to move from time to time to pick up some upgrade. I was aware of bombs which could be used with RMB but I have used them twice only - nothing special. Summing up - eventhough TeraBlaster is cheap (especially while on sale), it is completely not worth buying. Go find some free flash game on the Internet and have much more fun! "}
{"text" : "Been waiting on this one for a while now. It makes no sense as to why the enemy can attack during your turn and then gets their own turn to also attack but your squad can't. The melee attacks are a joke and are a quick time event. Bad translation I can deal with but the first actual enemy in a mech you fight is a damage sponge. Too bad I was really looking forward to a decent Front mission type game on Steam.  Yes I only played an hour but I know I will not play more. It's not fun to me at all.

{"text" : "I like the game ~ and I will continue to play it, but due to the fact that X.y.y.-Rezes are so slow to correct mistakes - I give negative feedback. Do you want to play any god at any time? - pay, buy a pack of gods for 500 rubles. (I bought on the incentive at a discount for 250r and returned the money back on a refund, but the gods remained unlocked, this is +) Not everything written below is a disadvantage of the game. Other players - may get caught adequate (more or less), or maybe get caught: a child, a toxic, a troll ... And the worst thing is when such an inadequate plays not alone, but with the same fucker, and you have to endure all their leaders in the chat (you can, of course, stir up), and at the end of the game (in the lobby) you will report such people for aggression, etc. (in all online games there are such players) Leavers - yes, they enrage everyone, they can pour because: offended, there were some things in the real world, tired of playing (f6), to no purpose. There is also DC - disqualified, who may have just crashed the game, turned off the Internet, went down the PC, or AFK stood for a long time. Clan - basically, at first, you need to buy all the chests in the clan store, and then you can leave, there is not much sense from it, and if there are many active players in the clan, then spam in the chat flows like a river. (since March 2020, the functionality of clans is disabled) Gods are not only gods like Odin and Thor, but also just heroes of mythology, legends and fairy tales like King Arthur and Baba Yaga. Gods sometimes: nerfed or buffed, change model, change abilities. Skins - there are normal, but there are: anime, black, gay, tranny, gender. Updates - After every major update for it, a patch is released in 1-4 days. Sometimes, due to an update, a god or a skin for a god is temporarily removed from the game. Login - Waiting for game data ... waiting can take up to 3-10 minutes. (the problem is solved, then it appears again) Lags - they are corrected, they appear again after the next update. Ping jumps - sometimes. Rare crashes - rarely, but sometimes it crashes to the desktop, for example, when loading a match or when starting a game, crashes on the screensavers. The queue timer is buggy - sometimes it shows 0, and sometimes it is not the time it really is. (the problem often appears) Inhibited choice of gods - you press on a god, and he is selected after 3 seconds or even after 20 seconds. (it happens) Bugs - you can sit for hours in the lobby and wait for the loading screen to start, but it turns out that the whole team is already playing, and you just need to restart the game. After the end of the round, you see how long it hangs on the "Defeat / Win" screen, and you just need to restart the game. "}

{"text" : "This is a GREAT game. An excellent plot with unexpected twists, almost a detective story. Nice cartoon stylization. Tons of humor, witty dialogue, and interesting puzzles. Achievements, localization and cards, after all. "What else do you want, dog?" you ask reasonably. There will be no intrigue, the claims are lower .... - (personal) Aren't you tired of the settings window being displayed every time you start the game on Unity? Moreover, in the game itself, there are some settings, and often they are duplicated ... However, it seemed too primitive for the authors to place the choice of language there, I tried unsuccessfully to switch the language to Setting (naive), but it turned out that I had to click the checkbox on the title screen ... However, nonsense. - Bugs. I came across several. These are not working scripts and the absence of "active" points of interaction ... So, after wandering around the game for about an hour, I got into the "solutions", which is desirable to avoid in such games. Everything is solved by restarting the game, but ... - Achievements not working. It turned out that this is a problem almost from the appearance of the game in Steam .. At least, if they cannot be repaired, then they could be removed. Game 2017, on this date the first posts about the problems above fall. It looks like the developers have finally "hammered" the game, and I recommend that you do the same. Ps Now the game is sold with 90%, it's somehow stupid to regret buying ..;) It's up to you to decide. "}
